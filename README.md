This project is focused on creating an AI chatbot for Angelo State University that helps students with any questions they might have. The chatbot will provide quick answers to a variety of topics, including things like scholarships, campus services, class registration, and general student life. By using advanced technology, the chatbot will make it easier for students to get the information they need and make their time at the university more enjoyable and efficient. The goal is to make student life a little less stressful by giving them easy access to helpful information.
