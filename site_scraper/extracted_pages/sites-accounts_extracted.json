Below is a list of items that a user name change are known to impact. There may be other issues that you encounter that cannot be foreseen. It is important to remember that some of these changes will be irreversible. Due to the number of systems on campus that use a User name based on your last name, it will be your responsibility to contact and change your information as noted for some systems. Depending on your role at the University, many of these may not apply to you.",
