        "These guidelines have been produced and disseminated as part of the university\u2019s marketing effort to provide consistency in design and quality of university and departmental web pages.",
        "A standard template has been designed with a consistent color scheme, fonts and design elements to provide a unified look for university web pages. The ASU website template provides a professional starting point for editors to focus on the informational rather than design components of their respective pages. It is intended to simplify the process of web updates and enhance the university\u2019s overall marketing to prospective students.",
        "The template design applies to all university pages within the ASU website to ensure consistency in layout, colors, fonts, navigation and overall look and feel.",
        "The unifying elements of the template are the top banner, section navigation, content section and footer.",
        "Web page editors should use only those colors approved for the ASU site as specified in the style sheet.",
        "Each page on the ASU site must use the approved template to ensure a consistent look and feel. The editable region within each template is available for departments to use to fit their specific needs. This area can be used for both text and graphics.",
        "The opening page for academic departments is the place to start recruiting students. Each academic department should have an opening page that provides a brief description of the department, its programs and the associated career opportunities, as well as departmental contact information. Do not overwhelm prospects with information. Inform them about what makes your department special and intrigue them with opportunities within a particular field.",
        "The opening page for non-academic departments and offices should include a brief introduction with information about what the office does. Contact information should also be readily available on the homepage.",
        "Keep the length of your pages to one or two screens of information. Limiting the amount of information helps with download time and generally results in a more visually appealing page. Use white space wisely. Breaking your content into sections, including headings, and using lists can help users scan your page and find relevant information more quickly. Be brief, concise and specific in your wording. You can often say more with less.",
        "If you would like more guidance about the information to share on your website, contact theOffice of Communications and Marketingto schedule a website enhancement project.",
        "Editors are those individuals who have received web training and are responsible for creating and updating web pages for a specific department or unit according to these guidelines. There are two types of website editors:",
        "Website editors cannot directly publish content to the web. They must submit all content for approval by the web team, who can publish, edit, or return the content for revisions.",
        "Because the ASU website is a major window into the university, visitors make judgments upon the university based upon what they see. Attention to accuracy, detail and design are important in making the best possible impression upon website visitors. Therefore, all content providers have the following responsibilities.",
        "External sites are sites that either reside on a web server other than www.angelo.edu but are considered official university pages, or sites that reside on the www.angelo.edu server.",
        "Sites hosted on other web servers, whether on- or off-campus are considered \u201cthird-party.\u201d Third-party sites that have affiliation with ASU should have a general design theme similar to the ASU design. These types of sites are considered official university pages and should follow the guidelines as described on this page whenever possible, including the use of approved colors and fonts. While not all third-party software and web servers allow for the same capabilities, and not all applications warrant identical layouts, care should be taken to ensure that design consistency appears across all ASU pages. Third-party sites should be reviewed and approved by Information Technology in conjunction with Communications and Marketing."
