        "\u201cMy dad played football, and my mom was an Angelette, so I grew up visiting ASU,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the campus. Everyone is so nice and friendly, and all the professors are quick to help and care about us as students. They understand the obstacles along the way and want to work with you.",

        "A freshman education major from Victoria, Reilly\u2019s first semester at Angelo State was a little rough.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re moving away from home,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new experience. It\u2019s a new town, a new environment. For freshmen, the first semester can be hard because you\u2019re adjusting to a different schedule. You don\u2019t have eight classes every day like in high school, so you have to learn time management.\u201d",

        "",
        "\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t involved, I would be stuck in my room,\u201d she said. \u201cJoining organizations helps you de-stress, and you also have people to lean on and hang out with. You make those connections when you\u2019re in classes or in your sorority. You have a big group of girls who are supportive when you need them; the same with RAMbassadors, they\u2019re always there for you.\u201d",
        "Not only is Reilly making lifelong connections, she is also gaining skills that will benefit her beyond her time at Angelo State.",
        "\u201cYou can become a leader,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you get involved in different things, there are more leadership opportunities. Having those leadership positions allows you to know more people.\u201d",

        "\u201cI come from a family of educators, and I enjoy working with small children,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to teach. I want to help kids. I was born with cerebral palsy, which means I had a stroke before birth. I can\u2019t use my left hand as much as I can my right. Rather than just sitting back and saying, \u2018I can\u2019t do it,\u2019 I overcame it.\u201d",
