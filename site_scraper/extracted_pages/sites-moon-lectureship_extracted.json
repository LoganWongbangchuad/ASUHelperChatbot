        "The Distinguished Lectureship in Science honors a beloved San Angelo physician who died in 1976 at the age of 64.",
        "For 28 years, Dr. Roy E. Moon practiced obstetrics and gynecology with Clinic Hospital Medical Associates, now known as West Texas Medical Associates of San Angelo. He was a diplomate of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a founding fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.",
        "Although he was a specialist in the diseases of women, as a general practitioner he frequently treated all members of the family. Moon loved the practice of medicine. The love and respect of his patients was his reward.",
        "His wife, Joy Moon, herself a holder of a Doctor of Philosophy degree in biology from Brown University, served as a valuable and insightful member of the Moon Lectureship Selection Committee until her death in 1992. They had a daughter, Martha, and a son, Roy.",
        "To this day, Moon\u2019s legacy remains his dedication to his profession, his devotion to his patients and his service to the community. His example still heartens all who cherish the image of the selfless family doctor."
