        "Your advisor has taken into account items that you may not have considered, such as: prerequisites, course rotation, degree requirements (by catalog), balancing your course workload and much, much more. In addition, advisors know how delaying some courses will delay your graduation.",
        "During the fall, you will be advised for spring courses; during the spring, you will be advised for summer and fall courses. Advise-a-RAMa information can be found on theAdvising website.",
        "Yes! We are able to advise you via email or over the phone. We prefer to advise you by email, if not in person, but either works for us. Please send an email to your advisor stating you want to be advised via email. If you do not have an advisor or do not know who your advisor is, you can emailcbadvisor@angelo.edu.",
        "Visit Room 201 in the Rassman Building and the Academic Advisors can help you complete the required paperwork. (It only takes a few minutes!)",

        "Requirements change and the catalog under which you file your official degree plan affects those requirements. You can file under any catalog year in which you have been a student continuously enrolled. Catalogs expire after seven years and you must complete your degree requirements before your chosen catalog expires. If you do not, you will be moved to a new catalog and degree requirements could change.",
        "A prerequisite is a requirement that must be met prior to taking a course and, typically, includes successfully completing another course or multiple courses. For example: Before enrolling in ACCT 2301, you must have successfully completed MATH 1324 (first business math course, Finite Math).",
        "A degree plan is an official document that you sign to declare your major and the catalog you intend to graduate under. Basically, it is a layout of courses needed to meet degree requirements.",
        "Once you have visited with the VETS Center in Room 113 of the Houston Harte University Center, you should schedule an appointment with your Academic Advisor in the Norris-Vincent College of Business. Your advisor will assist you with preparing your degree plan. The VETS Center only needs to review your degree plan if you are a graduate student.",

        "An internship is a temporary position that provides students with the opportunity to gain experience in their chosen field, determine if they have an interest in a particular career, create a network of contacts and/or gain school credit. Internships also provide employers with reduced cost labor and the prospect of interns returning to the company with minimal training required after completing their education.",
        "First, you must research where you would like to intern. You should begin researching at least one long semester prior to when you want to enroll in the internship program. You can begin your search with programs listed on theCenter for Career and Professional Success website.",
        "You must also obtain permission from the Internship Coordinator in you major\u2019s department. This should also be done the semester prior to the time you will begin the internship. Contact your major\u2019s department or a professional academic advisor to find out who the Internship Coordinator is for your major.",
        "Most corporate internship positions are paid, but some local internship positions may not be paid. Discuss with your professional academic advisor how this will affect your ability to work as an intern.",
