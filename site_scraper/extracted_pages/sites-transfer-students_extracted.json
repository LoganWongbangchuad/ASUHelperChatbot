        "Angelo State University has partnered with the following community colleges to offer pathways and transfer guides for students interested in transferring to ASU. These articulation agreements were created to help transfer students achieve their educational goals. We are committed to maximizing transfer credits while at the same time minimizing the cost and time required to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree.",
        "Please note that the following pathways and transfer guides are for students to utilize as a reference of what courses they can take at each institution. It\u2019s possible for students to take these courses in a different sequence if they are coming in with prior credit or if there are changes to course offerings and degree plans. Therefore, it is encouraged for students to reach out to their academic advisor at each institution to discuss current course options and sequences.",
