        "Federal regulations mandate institutions of higher education to establish policies to monitor the academic progress of all students who apply for and/or receive federal financial aid. Angelo State University (ASU) makes its minimum standards applicable to all federal, state and institutional financial aid programs for the purpose of maintaining a consistent policy for all financial aid applicants.",
        "The ASU Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships monitors Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) annually after the spring grades are posted of every enrolled student, regardless of whether they receive financial aid.",
        "Questions about the university\u2019s satisfactory academic policy for the ASU Distinguished Scholarship Program, institutional scholarships or other endowed scholarships can be obtained from theOffice of Financial Aid and Scholarships.",
        "There are three components to SAP. Failure to comply with any component may result in a loss of aid eligibility. The three components are as follows:",
        "Students are required to complete a percentage of all credits hours attempted for all periods or enrollment, including transfer credit hours, regardless of whether or not financial aid was received. To determine if you are meeting this requirement, total cumulative earned hours are compared to total cumulative attempted hours. Courses that are dropped or withdrawn from are considered as attempted hours regardless of the time of drop/withdrawal or the grade received. Grades of F, NC, NP, PR, W, and I are considered credit hours attempted, but no successfully completed and/or earned.",
        "Students are expected to complete their degree program within a maximum time frame of 150% of the published length of the program of study. This also includes transfer hours earned as well as institutional attempted hours. Credit hours are cumulative; thus, students working towards obtaining more than one degree in the same category (e.g., double major) may reach this maximum time frame before completing their course of study and may need to appeal eligibility.",
        "Students who fail to meet one or more of the SAP components at the end of the semester will lose their federal and state eligibility immediately. A student who fails to complete a single course or has a complete withdrawal from Angelo State University after receiving financial aid may be automatically placed on suspension.",
        "Please note: Financial Aid Probation and Suspension are separate from ACADEMIC probation and suspension.",
        "Students failing to meet minimum requirements will be notified through their ASU email address, as well as RamPort. Students are held responsible for reading and understanding the Satisfactory Academic Progress eligibility requirements and knowing their status at the end of each semester.",
        "Students are responsible for submitting documentation and accurate information requested by the ASU Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships in a timely manner and keeping copies for their own records. Students are responsible for checking their RamPort account regularly.",
        "If questions arise, contact the Office of Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at 325-942-2246.",
        "Recent federal regulations change the way enrollment status is determined for students who are repeating coursework in which they previously received a letter grade of D- or higher. An institution may pay a studentone timefor retaking previously-passed coursework. To determine a student\u2019s enrollment status (full time vs. part time), the school maynotinclude more than one retake of a previously passed course.",
        "Two years ago, Sam enrolled in a three-hour Applied Mathematics course and received a grade of D-. Sam took the same course again last year and received a grade of C-. His major requires that he pass the class with a C or better, so Sam decides to take the course again this semester. Sam is enrolled in nine hours of other coursework, plus the Applied Math class, for a total of 12 hours. The three hours of that class are NOT included in determining Sam\u2019s enrollment status for the current semester because it is the second time he is repeating a class in which he previously received a \u201cpassing\u201d grade. Sam would be paid financial aid as apart-time studentbecause he is enrolled in 12 hours minus the three hours of the course he\u2019s repeating for the second time, which do not count. For financial aid purposes, Sam is enrolled in nine eligible hours.",
        "If you feel that you had a special circumstance within the last 12 months that prevented you from making SAP, you can file an appeal. Some examples of special circumstances include:",
        "You will also need to provide backup documentation (e.g., obituaries, hospital bills, court orders) to substantiate your special circumstance.",
        "If you feel that you had aspecial circumstance within the last 12 monthsthat prevented you from making SAP, you can file an appeal. Some examples of special circumstances are the death of a close friend or family member, hospitalization or serious illness, legal issues, or other events of that magnitudeover which you had no control. Please note that if your reason for filing an appeal is not deemed a special circumstance, your appeal will be automatically denied. The decision of the appeal committee is final."
