        "The film industry in the U.S. is a multibillion-dollar business. We are increasingly a visual culture but not necessarily a visually literate culture. The purpose of a film studies minor at ASU is to build essential literacy skills, such as interpretive, visual, verbal, critical, audio-visual, and narrative literacy to survive in today\u2019s competitive marketplace. Students will acquire knowledge in filmmaking techniques, learn how to read visual and cultural cues and hone their skills in analyzing persuasive and rhetorical messages.",
        "Students interested in obtaining an academic minor in film studies, an interdisciplinary study of how film is both a record of social culture and a force for cultural change, are required to take a total of 18 hours, including 6 advanced hours.",
        "Two courses (6 hours) are required for this minor: Communication/Mass Media 1337 and English 4355. These courses will expose students who opt for a film studies minor to the basic technological, theoretical and artistic terminology and knowledge necessary to successfully interpret this art form.",
        "Students will take an additional 12 hours from the following selectedcourses *:",
        "Occasionally, University Studies and special topics courses will be offered in various departments which are appropriate for this minor. Students must receive permission to count such special topics courses in their film minor from the Dean of Arts and Humanities.",
        "* Courses taken to fulfill requirements for this minor may not also be counted toward the student\u2019s major."
