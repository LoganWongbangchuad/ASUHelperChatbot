        "The ASU Honors Program \u2014 Texas Tech School of Medicine Early Decision Program allows students meeting certain criteria to apply to the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) School of Medicine a year early, in the summer after their sophomore year. Interviews are usually conducted in November or December of their junior year, and acceptance decisions are announced in early February. Students accepted through this program can waive the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT).",
        "ASU students compete with students from Texas Tech, Austin College, West Texas A&M University and Lubbock Christian University for a limited number of seats; therefore, building a competitive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is critical for acceptance.",
        "To be eligible for this program, students must meet the following criteria prior to admission to Angelo State:",
        "Students considering applying to the Early Decision Program should notify the Honors Program director during their initial semester, as specialized advising is needed throughout the process. Students will be advised by both the Honors Program director and the senior pre-med advisor (currently Dr. Russell Wilke) each semester prior to and after acceptance into the Early Decision Program.",
        "This application is sent to the applicant by the TTUHSC School of Medicine after the TMDSAS Application is submitted and the student\u2019s information is verified. This process typically takes about two weeks, so students applying for the Early Decision Program need to submit their primary application by the end of August.",
        "The Honors Program director will provide this checklist to applicants.",
        "The CASPer test is an online screening tool designed to evaluate key personal and professional characteristics that the TTUHSC School of Medicine feels is important for medical students and graduates. A completed CASPer test submitted by the application deadline is required to maintain admission eligibility.",
        "Accepted students must complete four full years at Angelo State, maintain a minimum GPA of 3.7 overall and 3.6 in sciences through graduation, and graduate in good standing from the Honors Program. Students must also continue to complete the 100 hours per year in healthcare and service activities in both the junior and senior years."
