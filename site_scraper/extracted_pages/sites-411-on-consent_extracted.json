It may feel wrong to lie but you are never obligated to remain in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable, scared, or threatened. Some examples of these excuses include that you need to leave to help a friend, that you don\u2019t feel well, that you have an early day the next day, or that you told someone you\u2019d meet them at a certain time and need to get there. Whatever you need to say to stay safe is okay \u2013 even if it may seem embarrassing or rude at the time.",

Locate windows, doors, and any other way to exit the situation. Are there people close by that can help you? How can you get their attention? Where can you go when you leave?"
