        "Despite being a POW, Arthur Montgomery was still able to communicate with his wife. Their postcards and letters are preserved as part of this collection.",
        "Arthur Montgomery survived a downed bomber and ended up in a German POW camp in 1944. He was a ball-turret gunner, entering the service in 1942 and leaving behind a young wife, Bernice, and infant son, Lonnie.",
        "Bernice\u2019s letters convey her worry and uncertainty as communication was tightly controlled. Montgomery\u2019s answers are brief, but he constantly assures his wife that he is being treated well. However, POW letters were heavily censored, and the prisoners\u2019 conditions were severe.",
        "The Montgomerys\u2019 predicament was not unique, and it is a snapshot of how the war created anguish and pain for families in Texas and beyond.",
        "",
        "Sept. 21, 1944",
        "My Darling Wife,We can\u2019t be together today but the day is coming soon when we can. Then I will tell you the things I\u2019ve been thinking of today. I want you to know that I remembered the day and all it means.",
        "A.M.",
        "",
        "Nov. 9, 1944",
        "My darling wife and son,Everything is fine with us. Would like to have been home for Lonnie\u2019s first birthday. Have received only one letter. It was from Elizabeth. Darling, don\u2019t worry about anything. We will be together again soon.",
        "As ever, \u201cDainty\u201d",
        "",
        "October 3, 1944",
        "Hello darling,I just received your official address, so now I can write and tell you how glad we were to get your card last week. I never was so happy to see anyone\u2019s handwriting in all my life.",
        "Everyone here is well except for occasional colds. Calvin is going to college- the University of Texas- this year, and Maxine is working for a law firm here at home. James still has his old job.",
        "Honey, Lonnie will be ten months old this month. The day before our wedding anniversary, he took several steps and discovered he could walk without any help. Since then, he hasn\u2019t crawled anymore. He is twenty- seven inches tall and weighs about nineteen pounds. Too, he has quite a lot of hair now and four teeth. As soon as I can mail a package, I\u2019ll send you some pictures that were made when he was six months old.",
        "I received a letter from Loyd Carter the other day. He and Bill McGill both are still well.",
        "All our love,Bernice and Lonnie",
        "",
        "October 30",
        "Hello Sweetheart,I know you think I don\u2019t write very often, but the Red Cross advised me not to write too many letters each week. It has been nearly a month now since I have heard from you. Sometimes, I get awfully discouraged and lonesome. If I knew that you were getting our letters and packages it would be a great consolation.",
        "The other day, I went to see Frances and her baby. That was the first time I had seen Pamela Sue, and she is a beautiful child. All except her mouth- it is too large to be pretty. But she has dark eyes and blonde, curly hair. She and Lonnie had a good time playing together. The last time Johnny saw Pam, she was about Lonnie\u2019s age now. So both of you will never be able to realize how much your children have grown. While we were there, Pam had a birthday, and Frances took some snap-shots of them together. I hope they will be good.",
