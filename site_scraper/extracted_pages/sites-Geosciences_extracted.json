        "There is a real need for geoscientists in the workforce today, particularly here in oil-rich Texas. Great paying and fun jobs are just a few short years away.",
        "Although ourdegree programis still very young we are growing by leaps and bounds. At last count we were 100 majors strong and growing.",
        "We strive to provide an all-around education with an emphasis on the application of geoscience in the field. Our courses provide practical knowledge in the classics such as structural geology, mineralogy petrology, and sedimentology and stratigraphy, as well as the less traditional areas of hydrology, geochemistry, geophysics and volcanology. We also prefer that our majors gain real world experience and as such we provide ample opportunities forundergraduate research.",
        "Geologists and hydrologists study the composition, structure and other physical aspects of the Earth as well as the Earth\u2019s geologic past and present by using sophisticated instruments to analyze the composition of rocks and fluids. Many geoscientists search for natural resources, such as groundwater, petroleum, minerals and metals. Others work closely with environmental scientists to preserve and clean up the environment.",
        "The ASU Geosciences program includes a Bachelor of Science in Geosciences and a minor in Earth Science. Because the primary entry-level degree in the Geosciences is a master\u2019s degree, our primary educational objective is to prepare students for graduate study in geology, geophysics, engineering, environmental science and hydrology. This program emphasizes teaching fundamental field geology-based skills and analytical problem-solving techniques.",
        "Full-time faculty expertise and research interests are in traditional core areas of geology, including:",
        "Part-time geology faculty bring additional expertise in hydrology, planetary geology, geographic information science, astronomy and science education.",
        "The Geosciences bachelor\u2019s degree plan is interdisciplinary: students minor in a complementary field, such as physics, range and wildlife management, computer science, ecology and evolutionary biology, chemistry or mathematics. Students also take coursework in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Prior to graduation, students will be prepared to take the national Fundamentals of Geology Exam as part of Professional Geologist certification.",
        "Most students will complete an undergraduate research project. The San Angelo office of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) supervises several research projects and helps to teach several courses. The curriculum is coordinated with the Texas Tech University Department of Geosciences, a nationally respected master\u2019s degree and Ph.D. granting department.",
        "Employment growth of 18 percent is expected for geoscientists and hydrologists between 2008 and 2018, which is larger than the average for all occupations, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The average entry-level salary of 2008 M.S. graduates in oil industry positions was $86,600, a 35-percent increase in three years, according to the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.",
        "Geology professor creates a lasting legacy.",
        "Just like the settlers and prospectors of the past, Angelo State geology professor Dr. Joe Satterfield headed west to improve his fortunes and chase his dreams.",
        "September 17, 2018",
        "A group of 14 Angelo State geology students traveled more than 3,000 miles through five states over five weeks this summer for the experience of a lifetime known as Field Camp."
