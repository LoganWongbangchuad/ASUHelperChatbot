        "If you are a parent or guardian of a child younger than 18 years of age or expecting a child, please complete the self-disclosure form.

The goal of the accommodation is to modify the student\u2019s experience to address the condition while not altering the academic objectives or requirements of an individual course. Reasonable accommodations can be provided as long as the student\u2019s medical provider deems medically necessary. Possible reasonable accommodations include but are not limited to:",
        "In addition to reasonable accommodations, a student may also request a withdraw without academic penalty or a medical leave of absence if due to the student\u2019s condition they are unable to complete coursework. A student will be allowed to return to the same academic and extracurricular status as before the leave began.",
        "*Please note, the Office of Title IX Compliance will review each student\u2019s situation individually, as reasonable accommodations will be dependent on the requirements of individual courses.",

        "There are many ways in which pregnant or parenting students may request support. These options include:",
        "Angelo State has identified a parenting liaison to assist students who are parents of children under the age of 18 or expecting. The parenting liaison will work with you, along with the Title IX office, to make sure your needs are being met."
