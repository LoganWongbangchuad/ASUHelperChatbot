        "Jessie Merrifield was born in Arkansas on July 9, 1933, but grew up in the small West Texas town of Ballinger. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1953-61, and then returned to Texas for the rest of his life as a carpenter. He had a front-row seat to see the changes a global war and post-conflict economic boom had on the local level in smaller cities and towns like Ballinger.",
