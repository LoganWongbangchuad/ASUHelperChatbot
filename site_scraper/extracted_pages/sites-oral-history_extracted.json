        "We are interested in all types of material. We are interested in photos, letters, diaries, memoirs, certificates, and other similar items. We can also include images of physical objects, such as a flag or uniform.",
        "No. We scan your documents and take photographs of physical objects. You then keep the item and we will send you a CD with the digital scans, so you have a copy to keep as well.",
        "That varies a lot. Interviews are generally 1-2 hours, though some are shorter and some longer. Scanning is slow if you have a very long document or many photographs. You can opt to wait at our office or you can leave an item with us temporarily and then pick it up another day. We will need you to spend a small amount of time explaining the documents if you choose this option. If your items are very fragile, we will discuss with our archivist the best way to scan them without damaging them and this may require bringing the item to the Angelo State campus.",
        "If you can\u2019t make it to San Angelo, contact us anyway. We are making several trips to other West Texas locations and making appointments during those visits. We can schedule an appointment with you for one of those visits. We can also discuss options with partner institutions if an appointment doesn\u2019t work out. We can complete phone interviews as well. Contact us and we can discuss options depending on your circumstances and location.",
        "Please contact us atoral.history@angelo.edu. Fixes/edits are relatively easy to make. Also, please contact us if you would like to add any additional material or explanations.",
