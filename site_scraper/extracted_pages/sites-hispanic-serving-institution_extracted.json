        "Since 2010, Angelo State University has held the designation of Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), awarded by the U.S. Department of Education to universities with 25% or more Latino/a students in their undergraduate population.",
        "Since that time, our Latino/a community has grown to 42%, as of fall 2018. Reaching the HSI threshold confirms ASU as an \u201cEligible Institution.\u201d This status makes ASU eligible for a variety of federal grants such as Titles III and V programs through the Department of Education, United States Department of Agriculture, National Science Foundation, and others.",
        "After an unsuccessful 1923 bid to be selected as the home of Texas Technological College, the residents of San Angelo decided they would create their own college, even if they had to pay for it themselves. Funded by local contributions and a self-imposed county tax, San Angelo Junior College opened its doors in 1928 on North Oakes Street near downtown San Angelo.",
        "The college ultimately dropped \u201cJunior\u201d from its name to become San Angelo College, or SAC, as it would be known until it became Angelo State University in 1965.",
        "When it outgrew its downtown campus, the college moved to its current location, though tax monies were inadequate to make the change to a new campus. The residents of San Angelo stepped in and raised $300,000 to help make the transition. The university broke ground on the Administration Building in 1947.",
        "By the 1950s, SAC was growing on its new campus on West Avenue N, thanks to the GI Bill\u00ae and a growing emphasis on education.",
        "During the 1950s, SAC was a pioneer in racial relations, admitting its first black students a year before Brown vs. Board of Education and in 1955 graduating its first black student, Mary Frances Simpson, the outstanding graduate that year. SAC also broke the color barrier in Texas intercollegiate football in 1953 when Ben Kelly, who later that academic year would be named class favorite, started for the Rams. Two years later, he would be drafted by the San Francisco Forty-Niners.",
        "The 1960s were a time of change as San Angelo College evolved into a four-year, state-supported university, fulfilling the dreams of local residents all the way back to the 1920s.Read the full history of ASU.",
