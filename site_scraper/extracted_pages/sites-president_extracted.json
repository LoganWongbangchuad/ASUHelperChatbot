        "President Ronnie D. Hawkins Jr.",
        "It is my great pleasure to welcome you to Angelo State University, home of the Ram Family.",
        "Being a family means we take care of our own, and as an ASU alumnus, I can attest to that first hand.",
        "I came to ASU to earn my degree, and I was fortunate to also receive a track and field scholarship and be a member of the Rams team that won several conference championships. The landscape of the campus has changed a lot since I graduated in 1977, but what hasn\u2019t changed is the dedication of our outstanding faculty and staff to give our students an exceptional college experience \u2013 academically, socially and culturally.",
        "That dedication has led to annual recognition of ASU as one of the nation\u2019s \u201cBest Colleges\u201d by The Princeton Review, a \u201cMilitary Friendly School\u201d by G.I. Jobs magazine, a \u201cCollege of Distinction\u201d by the Colleges of Distinction college guide, and a \u201cGreat College to Work For\u201d by the Chronicle of Higher Education, among others.",
        "However, the most gratifying results are the outcomes for our graduates. Students come in as a customer of Angelo State, but they go out a product of Angelo State. We want to make them the best product to the world that they can be by helping them achieve success in their careers, in their communities and in life.",
        "We also understand that the main concern for many students and parents is the cost of going to college. Due to the incredible support of numerous donors, ASU students have access to hundreds of endowed scholarships, highlighted by the Distinguished Scholarship Program that is only available at ASU. Nearly half of our students receive a Distinguished Scholarship every year, and about 90% of our students receive some form of financial aid.",
        "I also received a Carr ROTC Scholarship when I was a student, so I know what a blessing financial aid can be. We want our students to be able to concentrate on their education, and then graduate without the burden of debt blocking their pathway to success.",
        "A lot of exciting things are happening at ASU as we continue to add state-of-the-art academic and cultural facilities, and expand and improve our academic and student life programs. There really is something for everyone at Angelo State, and now is an exhilarating time to be part of the Ram Family.",
        "If you are already a member of the Ram Family, whether a student, faculty, staff, alumnus, donor or friend, I\u2019m proud to be your president and humbled to lead such an exceptional institution. If you are thinking about joining the Ram Family, I invite you to check out our website and visit our scenic campus to see everything that ASU has to offer.",
        "With Ram Pride,Ronnie HawkinsASU President"
