        "An eclipse is a natural phenomenon that happens when one celestial object, like the moon or Earth, moves in front of another, causing a temporary shadow. The two most common types of eclipses are solar eclipses and lunar eclipses.",
        "",
        "A solar eclipse is when the moon gets between the Earth and the sun. The moon covers the sun and casts its shadow on the Earth. Depending on how the moon covers the sun, we can have three types of solar eclipses:",
        "",
        "A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, and it blocks the sunlight from reaching the moon. When this happens, the moon gets dimmed and sometimes looks red.",
        "More Events",
        "During a solar eclipse, it\u2019s important to protect your eyes from the sun\u2019s harmful rays. Looking directly at the sun, even during an eclipse, can seriously hurt your eyes and even cause permanent damage.",
        "To keep your eyes safe, you must use special eclipse glasses or solar filters to safely watch a solar eclipse. These glasses have special lenses that block harmful light, allowing you to enjoy the eclipse without any worries. Remember, never use regular sunglasses or homemade filters for eclipse watching \u2013 only certified eclipse glasses or approved solar filters will keep your eyes out of harm\u2019s way!",
        "On the other hand, lunar eclipses are generally safe to watch with the naked eye.",

        "If you\u2019re an educator in need of lessons, engaging activities or assistance in planning an event centered around the captivating world of eclipses, don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch with either Dr. Kenneth Carrell or our physics department. We\u2019re here to provide you with the resources and support you need to create an educational and awe-inspiring experience for your students.",
