        "Phil George was born in Austin, Texas on June 3, 1924. At the age of 18, George hitchhiked to San Antonio with a friend to sign up for the United States Army Air Corps, and was selected to join the pilot training program. He completed his aviation training in the US before being deployed to the Pacific, where he spent most of his time at Chikyang, a remote airfield in western China the US had taken over from the Japanese.",
        "Phil George with his wife, Toddy.",
        "Following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August of 1945, George was sent on a mission to transport displaced members of the Chinese government from Chungking to Nanking in eastern China, which the Japanese had overtaken in 1937. In this interview segment, George recounts the mission and the unexpected Japanese welcoming party that met them in Nanking with characteristic humor and candor.",
        "This is an excerpt from theinterview with Phil George,pgs. 35-38.",
        "GEORGE: So, the command post calls me down to Chikyang right after - we didn\u2019t know what to - we didn\u2019t have iPhones or any of that.",
        "GRITTER: Yeah.",
        "GEORGE: So, it was probably - and I\u2019m guessing, my memory\u2019s - probably two and half or three days after Hiroshima that we heard that some exceptional big bomb had gone off and killed a lot of people.",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm.",
        "GEORGE: And, uh, we didn\u2019t know what it meant at that time. And then when the second one went off, at Nagasaki, I guess it was a day later, and they called me to command post and said, \u201cYou need to go to Chungking and pick up the Nationalist government.\u201d Now, if you\u2019ll check your history, \u2026",
        "GRITTER: Wow.",
        "GEORGE: \u2026the Japanese overran Eastern China in 1937.",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: They came in through Manchuria and all down the Eastern side and Nanking, which is over on the Eastern side, was the capital of China. And so, they killed many, many thousands of Chinese and they assaulted and raped a lot of women and it was horrible.",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm.",
        "GEORGE: That was in 1937. So, the Chinese civilian people that had been in the government that had escaped had been evacuated to Chungking, which is over in Western China. Said, \u201cYou need to go over and pick \u2018em up and take \u2018em to Nanking so that they could be in place to take over the government.\u201d And hopefully get a bunch of the Japanese files and stuff before they destroy them, hopefully.",
        "GRITTER/DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "GEORGE: Heck yeah, I\u2019ll go do that.",
        "GRITTER: Yeah.",
        "GEORGE: Well that\u2019s going pretty much all the way across East of China. So, I\u2019ve got these, uh, I think there were 42 of them, Chinese civilians in the back and I\u2019ve got a copilot and I\u2019ve got my engineer and myself and we\u2019re headed to Nanking. We have no charts or anything we had an old surface map that showed rivers and terrain heights and stuff like that and we did it by pilotage that picked up headings and then we\u2019d try to figure drift because we could see it wasn\u2019t weather\u2026",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm.",
        "GEORGE: \u2026and we\u2019d see and. Anyway, we\u2019d been flying about uh, I\u2019d say four and a half, uh, forty-five minutes and my copilot said, \u201cPhil, look out here on the right wing.\u201d I looked out there and there was a Japanese Zero sitting out there.",
        "GRITTER: Oh wow.",
        "DICKMEYER: Oh, my goodness.",
        "GEORGE: The first thought I - first thought I had, honestly - I hope he knows about Nagasaki and\u2026",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: \u2026Hiroshima. Okay there\u2019s international hand signals you use when you see each other in the cockpit. And he was wagging his wings and I was wagging mine. He\u2019s sitting in a canopy and you can see his head up and we\u2019re in a closed canopy but he - we got windows you can see. And he\u2019s pointing down and, okay. So, we\u2019re going down in formation and I\u2019m not gonna do anything to give him a false impression, I\u2019m gonna go slow and easy and maintain the heading until he gives me some indication to change.",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm.",
        "GEORGE: And probably we were like that for 20 to 25 minutes and he took us into Nanking. And when we landed, \u2018course they weren\u2019t expecting us, so masses of Japanese surrounded the plane. And I thought, \u201cOh boy.\u201d And I\u2019m just 20 years old so what do I know about anything?",
        "GRITTER: [Chuckles]",
        "GEORGE: So, I say, \u201cOkay it\u2019s my responsibility I\u2019ve got to do something, I don\u2019t know what but I\u2019ve got to.\u201d",
        "GRITTER/DICKMEYER: [laughter]",
        "GEORGE: So, I told \u2018em, the guys on the crew, \u201cY\u2019all stay on the plane.\u201d Then I told the leader of the Chinese, \u201cY\u2019all stay on the plane.\u201d",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm.",
        "GEORGE: And I went back and got off the plane.",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm.",
        "GEORGE: And I have no idea what the rank of the Japanese guy was but I\u2019m sure he was a colonel or something because he spoke with authority. And I\u2019m looking and here\u2019s these hundreds of Japanese, all armed to the teeth, and I - all I\u2019ve got on is a side-arm.",
        "GRITTER/DICKMEYER: [Laughter]",
        "GEORGE: I\u2019m not about to turn her in or anything. But anyway. They had briefed us months before that if you encounter Japanese for either - in any way, in other words if they\u2019re captives or if you\u2019re captives or whatever about one in four can speak English. So, I had remembered that and I said \u201cDo any of y\u2019all speak English?\u201d",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: And about three or four of them said \u201cYes, we do.\u201d And so I apologized for not speaking Japanese and said, \u201cTell me what it is y\u2019all want me to do.\u201d",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: Okay, the guy wanted to know what we were doing there. And I figured don\u2019t, don\u2019t try to fool these people just be honest, tell them the truth. And I said, \u201cI have on board 42 Chinese civilians that were in the municipal government in Chungking that I was ordered to bring here to try to help in the transition for the peace and all.\u201d",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: And then the guy says, \u201cThe peace hasn\u2019t been signed.\u201d I thought what in the world have I\u2026",
        "GRITTER/DICKMEYER: [Laughter]",
        "GEORGE: \u2026done now? I mean.",
        "GRITTER: Wow.",
        "GEORGE: So, he says, \u2018You\u2019re on Japanese territory.\u201d He could have told me I was a rocket ship and I\u2019d have to believe it \u2018case he\u2019s got me outnumbered and everything.",
        "GRITTER: Yeah. [Chuckle]",
        "GEORGE: But anyway. So, I said to him, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d He said, \u201cI want you to get back in that airplane and go back to your base.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d He said, \u201cAre you refusing to do it?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes and no.\u201d or words to that affect.",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: He said, \u201cI\u2019m ordering you.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do something else. I\u2019m not gonna fly this plane out of here.\u201d",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: Okay let me tell you why I wouldn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t have enough fuel to go back and it was getting dark and Chikyang doesn\u2019t have one light-bulb.",
        "GRITTER/DICKMEYER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: So, I would have crashed somewhere - lack of fuel.",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: And so, I started to explain that to him and I see him turning and speaking Japanese to some of them.",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: And their conversation maybe lasted uh, three minutes, four minutes. They were really jabbering. He said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re gonna take your crew and we\u2019re gonna incarcerate y\u2019all. The Chinese have to stay on the plane and we\u2019re gonna put guards on - can\u2019t get off of it. They got to stay on board the plane.\u201d They said, \u201cIn the morning we\u2019ll give you some gas and you get your butt out of here.\u201d Excuse me, \u201cget - get out of here.\u201d",
        "GRITTER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: So, I thought, that\u2019s a lot better than getting shot so.",
        "GRITTER/DICKMEYER: Mhmm",
        "GEORGE: I wasn\u2019t crazy about getting shot - little bit crazy",
        "GRITTER: [Laughter]",
        "GEORGE: And now this wasn\u2019t any bravery on my part \u2018cause I didn\u2019t think I had another option; if I got in there and tried to go we would\u2019ve all died and I wasn\u2019t gonna do that. So, I\u2019d rather take my chances.",
