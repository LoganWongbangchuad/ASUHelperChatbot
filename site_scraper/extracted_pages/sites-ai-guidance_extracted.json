        "Use of Generative AI toolsGenerative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and others, are now being widely used in business and industry to assist with the development of written content within seconds. Some faculty members may choose to provide expert guidance to their students on how to use such tools in an ethical and responsible manner when completing their course assignments. However, unless the instructor explicitly states in the course syllabus that students may use generative AI tools to develop content that is submitted as part of an assignment for a course, their use in that course is prohibited. For more information, please see OP 10.26 Use of Generative AI Tools by Students.",
        "Faculty may want to consider adding information into their syllabus that guide students on what is or is not acceptable in their classes based on how students may or may not interact with AI to complete course work.",
        "You are welcome to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools (add examples of tools that best fit your course, e.g. ChatGPT, Dall-e, etc.) in this class as doing so aligns with our course learning goals(consider adding your course goals here). Students are responsible for the information you submit based on an AI query and for assuring that it does not contain misinformation or unethical content and that it does not violate intellectual property laws. Your use of AI tools must be properly documented and cited for academic integrity. For this course, we will use[Insert citation style for your discipline and perhaps an example of an AI citation according to this style.]",
        "You are permitted to use ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) tools to assist you in gathering information and brainstorming ideas but you may not copy and paste information. Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one\u2019s own class and/or course work, being individually accountable, and demonstrating intellectual honesty and ethical behavior. Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility. Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect. Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured. Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors. Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning. Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly. You are responsible for the information you submit based on an AI query and for assuring that it does not contain misinformation or unethical content and that it does not violate intellectual property laws. You are expected to include a disclosure statement at the end of your assignment describing which AI tool you used and how you used it. For example, \u201cChatGPT was used to draft about 50 percent of this paper and to provide revision assistance. AI-produced content was edited for accuracy and style. Your use of AI tools must be properly documented and cited for academic integrity. For this course, we will use[Insert citation style for your discipline and perhaps an example of an AI citation according to this style.]",
        "Generally speaking, you are not allowed to use artificial intelligence (AI) engines, software, or artwork generating programs to produce work for this class EXCEPT on X(consider specifying the particular assignment in which AI is allowed). I will provide more information about this specific assignment when the time is appropriate in the course. You may not, however, construe this limited use as permission to use these technologies in any other facet of this course.",
        "The use of generative AI tools (add examples of tools that students might use based on the context of your course) are not permitted in this course; therefore, any use of AI tools for work in this class may be considered a violation of ASU\u2019s Academic Integrity policy and the Student Code of Conduct since the work is not your own. The use of unauthorized AI tools will result in referral to the Office of Student Conduct.",
        "You should not enter data classified as confidential (including non-public research data, finance, HR, student records, medical information, etc.) into publicly available Generative AI tools, in accordance with the ASU\u2019s Privacy Policy. Information shared with Generative AI tools using default settings is not private and could expose proprietary or sensitive information to unauthorized parties.",
