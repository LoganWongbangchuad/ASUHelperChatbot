        "The Office of Title IX Compliance offers a wide range of supportive measures to assist students, faculty, and staff who have experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct.",
        "Supportive measures are actions the University may implement for students when the initial report is filed, to eliminate a hostile environment and address effects from incidents of sexual misconduct, prior to the initiation of any Investigation and/or formal Grievance Process. Supportive measures may be implemented regardless of whether or not the Complainant pursues a Formal Complaint or criminal action. Supportive measures are available to all parties involved, and are not considered sanctions.",
        "*Please note, all supportive measures are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",
        "A No Contact Order is a directive issued by the University that officially instructs parties not to interact with each other. All \u201ccontact\u201d is prohibited in person, in writing, through electronic means (any social media platforms, text messages, emails, etc.), and through a third party (such as a family member or friend).",
        "A No Contact Order may be requested by either party, and all parties are held to the same standard for complying with the order. It is important to know that an allegation of violating a No Contact Order is referred to the Office of Student Conduct for investigation and potential disciplinary sanctions."
