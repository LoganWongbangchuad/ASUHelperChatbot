        "During winter, our attention turns to indoor activities - family gatherings, holiday events, and keeping out of the cold by spending more time inside.",
        "Here, we will focus on three respiratory viral infections that are highly infectious - the flu, COVID-19 and RSV. Because all three have very similar signs and symptoms, the best way to tell the difference and get a diagnosis is by getting tested. The earlier an illness is diagnosed, the sooner a course of treatment can be identified. Getting treated early can reduce the risk of getting very sick.",
        "The flu is caused by the influenza virus and spreads more easily during the winter months.",
        "The Flu Vaccine is free to students who have paid their Medical Services Fee. Distance learners who would like to have access to campus health services can opt in by paying theMedical Services Fee.",
        "There\u2019s a $35 vaccination fee for flu shots for ASU faculty and staff and community members. Cash, checks and insurance are accepted. If you are submitting insurance, no payment is required at the time of service. Please bring your insurance card.",
        "A high-dose flu vaccine is also available.",
        "You can also visit the on-campus Shannon Clinic-Jackson to get your vaccine(s). Clinic hours are Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 5 p.m.",
        "The Daily Wellness Screening is no longer required. Please handle COVID-19 as you would any other illness. If you are feeling sick, please stay home and seek the advice of a medical professional.",
        "Please continue to practice good hygiene while on campus. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. It\u2019s especially important to wash your hands before eating, preparing food or touching your face.",
        "We encourage the Ram Family to follow guidance from theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionandkeep the Ram Fam healthy.",
        "If you have paid your Medical Services Fee, you may visit any Shannon Urgent Care location.",
        "If you are instructed to quarantine or isolate, you will be required to work individually with each of your professors to determine the appropriate method for continued class participation.

        "If you test positive for COVID-19 or are living with a family member who has tested positive, please contact your direct supervisor for next steps.",
        "If you feel you need to be tested for COVID-19, you can get tested atShannon Clinic.",

        "RSV is caused by the respiratory syncytial virus, a highly contagious virus that can infect children and adults. In infants and the elderly, the symptoms can be more severe, while in adults and older children, RSV is typically milder.",
        "In adults and older children, typical RSV symptoms include:",
        "In younger children and the elderly or immunocompromised, RSV can cause a lower respiratory tract illness such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, and in more severe cases can result in respiratory failure. Severe symptoms may include:",
