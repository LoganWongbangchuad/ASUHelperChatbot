        "Students interested in the Integrated B.B.A./M.B.A. in Finance will be required to complete a minimum of 150 semester credit hours of degree credit. Of this total, 120 semester credit hours will be at the undergraduate level and 30 semester credit hours will be at the graduate level. The undergraduate course requirements are identical to those for the non-integrated B.B.A/ in Finance, and the graduate course requirements are identical to those for the M.B.A. Therefore, this five-year integrated B.B.A./M.B.A. program has a true 4+1 modular structure.",
        "Candidates for this program must meet the current admission requirementsfor the M.B.A. program and be unconditionally admitted before taking anygraduate M.B.A. courses. The student must achieve a cumulative GPA of3.00 or better in all undergraduate courses and a cumulative GPA of 3.00 orbetter in all graduate courses.",
        "A unique feature of the integrated program is that the student will begin taking graduate course work in his/her senior year. Upon successful completion of all 150 semester credit hours of this five-year program, the student will be awarded both the B.B.A. in Finance and the M.B.A. degree at the same time; the student will not receive the B.B.A. in Finance after completing 120 semester credit hours at the undergraduate level.",
        "Should a student decide not to complete the M.B.A. portion of the integrated program, then this student would have to complete any remaining degree requirements for the B.B.A. in Finance in order to be awarded that degree. Because of the 4+1 structure of the integrated program, all of the undergraduate courses already completed as part of the integrated five-yearprogram would count towards completion of the B.B.A. in Finance."
