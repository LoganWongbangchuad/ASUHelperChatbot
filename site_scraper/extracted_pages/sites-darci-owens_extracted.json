        "The Department of Agriculture\u2019s 2022 Distinguished Alumnus, Darci Owens, turned her passion for agriculture into the career she loves.",
        "",
        "Showing and raising livestock in her hometown of Big Lake, Texas, Darci acquired her love for agriculture. She graduated from Angelo State University in 2007 with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Animal Science with a minor in Meat and Food Science, followed by the completion of a Master\u2019s degree in Animal Science in 2009. Currently working with six thousand volunteers to bring agriculture into the city and organizing every facet of rodeo production, Darci is the Rodeo Officer for the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo.",
        "During her time at ASU, Darci participated in numerous student organizations including Block and Bridle, Delta Tau Alpha, Recruiting Ag Majors, and numerous intramural sports. She was also a recipient of the Carr Scholarship and the San Antonio Livestock Exposition Scholarship.Directly out of college, Darci worked for Certified Angus Beef in Wooster, Ohio. She later moved back to Texas to take on the role of Livestock Coordinator for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo which helped open the door to her current position as Rodeo Officer for the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo. Darci enjoys her job, hanging out with friends, helping her father on the family ranch, and traveling around the country. What she loves the most is getting to know the volunteers in San Antonio and getting involved with families in other communities to touch other people\u2019s hearts with agriculture.",
        "Darci felt that ASU provided her with huge opportunities, and she had multiple avenues to try many things. Not only was she seen and heard, but Angelo State University made her into something greater. Darci cherishes the relationships she gained with her former professors and instructors. She values the relationships she made and keeps up with a lot of alumni that played such a large role in her life at ASU.",
        "Darci believes the agriculture industry has a bright future ahead. Although there is still much to be discovered, you can do absolutely anything you put your mind to. Darci encourages students to stay flexible and keep your mind open to new opportunities. Your destiny is controlled by the opportunities you capitalize on."
