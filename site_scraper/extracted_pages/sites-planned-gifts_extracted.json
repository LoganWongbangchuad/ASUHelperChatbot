        "As a planned-gift donor, you ensure that ASU continues to grow and advance for future generations of students. Gifts can be unrestricted, or you may designate your gift to support an area of your choice.",
        "All financial situations are unique, and making good decisions requires prudent planning. Wise decisions while planning a gift can maximize the benefits to both you and Angelo State. We can identify the types of giving opportunities best suited for you.",
        "When we began our estate planning process, we knew we wanted to include ASU because the university has given so much to us. We feel honored to establish a scholarship endowment as a lasting legacy for ASU, and to be able to make a difference in the lives of the next generation of ASU students.",
        "David and Jo Nell Harlow",
        "Founded in 2005, theOaks Societyhonors and recognizes those who have chosen to benefit Angelo State University through charitable gift plans.",
        "The Oaks Society represents service, generosity and legacy. In 1949, oak trees were planted in front of what is now the Mayer Administration Building in memory and honor of each of the 30 former students who lost their lives in World War II. In their personal ways, Oaks Society members have opportunities to leave their own legacies at ASU."
