        "We are excited to introduce Blackboard Learn Ultra, an upgraded Learning Management System set to transform our online learning environment.",
        "More modern, efficient and effective by nature, Blackboard Learn Ultra allows us to provide an enhanced learning experience for our students. While our courses are still in Original Course View, the update to Base Navigation in May/Summer 2024 gives us a sneak peek at Ultra\u2019s improved functionality. We plan to switch over to Blackboard Learn Ultra in a phased approach. Throughout the summer and this fall, we will have 19 different faculty members, representing all five colleges, become early adopters. They will receive training in the new platform, with the goal of all their Spring 2025 courses launching in Ultra.",
        "Over the next academic year, the remainder of the faculty will have the opportunity to experience the enhanced features and intuitive design of Ultra during our soft-launch phases in Spring and Summer 2025. This gradual transition ensures ample time for adaptation and support, enabling faculty to familiarize themselves with Ultra\u2019s innovative tools and streamlined interface. The goal is for the entire campus to be utilizing the Ultra platform by Spring 2026.",
        "Become an Adopter",
        "\u201cStudents will love the module-based learning environment in Blackboard Ultra.\u201d",
        "Tammy Stafford, D.N.P., Nursing",
        "No remodel happens overnight, and this isn\u2019t a quick fix. It\u2019s a comprehensive rebuild that will take a whole crew of faculty, IT and instructional designers. Together, we can tackle this renovation timeline.",
        "\u201cYou should 100% get trained and start building your courses in Ultra. You will find the course is better designed and easier to keep up with in regards to due dates and what students are doing. It was easier to create content in learning modules and eliminated all the course links I had to use before.\u201d",
        "Veronica Snow, D.S.M., Kinesiology, Chair of Instruction Technology Committee",
        "The decision to switch to Blackboard Learn Ultra was made with careful consideration of the needs of faculty and students.",
        "The Ultra Course View has a more modern design and easy-to-use interface with some new tools that are not available in the Original Course View, like Progress Tracking and Discussion Analytics. However, some Original Course View functionality has been discontinued in the Ultra Course View. Many early adopters have been attracted to the new features in Ultra.",
        "Plus, monthly updates are pushed by Anthology to keep up with the ever-changing needs of faculty and students.",
        "We\u2019re actively seeking participants to start teaching in the Ultra environment in Summer and Fall 2025. Fill out the form below to start the process.",
