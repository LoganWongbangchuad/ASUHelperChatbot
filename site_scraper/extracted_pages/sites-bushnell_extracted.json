        "D.R. Bushnell, Jr. was born on August 11, 1925. Growing up on a ranch in Johnson City, TX, Bushnell rarely traveled more than 20 miles beyond his hometown before he was drafted into the US Navy in 1943 at the age of 18. However, he soon found himself traveling by train from San Antonio to San Diego, CA for boot camp, and later to San Clemente Island for radar training before serving on an escort aircraft carrier in the South Pacific. In this interview segment, Bushnell describes the fear he experienced leaving his small hometown for the first time.",
        "This segment comes from the edited transcript of Bushnell\u2019s interview,pgs. 1-6.",
        "BUSHNELL: I was born in Johnson City on August 11th, 1925 in a house that was on Avenue C and\u2026 I can\u2019t think of the\u2026 but it was on Avenue C here in Johnson City.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: And I don\u2019t know how long we lived there but after I was born we moved out on a place\u2026 what they called\u2026 on quarter ranches. Out there right over on the other side of Flat Creek.",
        "DICKMEYER: Okay.",
        "BUSHNELL: My uh, I think it was\u2026 my mother inherited 246 acres of land. And we built, they built a house on it in 19 - I remember \u201931 because that\u2019s the year I started school. Uh, I lived at the time with my grandmother and my - in Johnson City. But we went\u2026 I attended Johnson City school.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: And we had to walk probably half a mile every day.",
        "DICKMEYER: Okay. And, um, when and where did you enter the Navy? How did you get involved with that?",
        "BUSHNELL: They drafted me.",
        "DICKMEYER: [laughs] Oh okay, yeah.",
        "BUSHNELL: I graduated from high school when I was eighteen. Of course I had a draft notice waiting in the mail for me.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: And I went to San Antonio for examine - to be examined and they passed me. And I don\u2019t know, I got about two weeks off and had to go back down there and they - I don\u2019t remember just what day but they assigned me to the Navy.",
        "DICKMEYER: Yeah. And what year was this? Sorry.",
        "BUSHNELL: Huh?",
        "DICKMEYER: What year was this?",
        "BUSHNELL: This was in \u201943.",
        "DICKMEYER: Okay.",
        "BUSHNELL: And then they got home - I got to come back home for a few\u2026 but I don\u2019t know how long then had to go back to San Antonio and then they put us on a troop train. Our train to go to San Diego.",
        "DICKMEYER: Hmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: Scared to death.",
        "DICKMEYER: Yeah.",
        "BUSHNELL: Let me tell you a little story.",
        "DICKMEYER: Please.",
        "BUSHNELL: I hadn\u2019t hardly ever been out of Johnson City in that eighteen years. Oh I might go to play basketball or something but as far as - we didn\u2019t have an automobile.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: And I got down there in San Antonio and they had a bunch of - a bunch of us ready to go to San Diego and this guy\u2026 one of the men yelled, \u201cBushnell!\u201d Went over there and he handed me a list of people. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of this draft in San Diego.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know a thing about\u2026 doing anything like that.\u201d I said - He said, \u201cWell just don\u2019t worry about it\u2026\u201d he said, \u201cTry to get most of \u2018em on the train.\u201d But he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get the rest of \u2018em up if they don\u2019t show up.\u201d Sure enough, there were a few of them that didn\u2019t show up but I had pretty good luck.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: Went to San Diego, [cough] went through boot camp\u2026",
        "DICKMEYER: Right.",
        "BUSHNELL: \u2026and, uh, after I got through boot camp I went to Santa Clemente. And there I went to radar training school.",
        "DICKMEYER: You said you went to where again, San\u2026?",
        "BUSHNELL: San Clemente Island.",
        "DICKMEYER: Oh, Clemente. Oh I\u2019ve been there, yes.",
        "BUSHNELL: Yeah. Went to radar school there. After I got out of radar early, sent me back to Balboa Park in San Diego, which was a receiving station. Until we had got assigned to a ship. Then after we got assigned to the ship - it was, uh, what they called\u2026 well we called it a Kaiser coffin. It was made in Astoria, Oregon. So we got on the trip - the ship, uh, on the train. Went to Astoria. Well, went to Brimington first.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: Our ship wasn\u2019t ready, we stayed in Brimington a few weeks until our ship was ready to go. And then from Brimington we went to Astoria, Oregon. There we got on a ship. I\u2019d say three-fourths of the ship - people - men on the ship was maybe my age.",
        "DICKMEYER: Right.",
        "BUSHNELL: And we sailed down to Long Beach, California. This was sometime in the early part of \u201944.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: We loaded up with planes and supplies headed for the South Pacific. We stopped in the Marshall Islands and got rid of some of the equipment and supplies. We land at Guadalcanal - which was still active down there and got rid of the rest of it. We came back to, uh, to Honolulu or somewhere about in there. And then when we came on back to John- to San Diego or Long Beach and got more planes and more supplies and\u2026",
        "DICKMEYER: So you said this is your first time out of Johnson City. What was it like to go to all these new places out in California and then the Pacific?",
        "BUSHNELL: Well I was scared to death. [laughs]",
        "DICKMEYER: [laughs]",
        "BUSHNELL: You don\u2019t know how it is. You know, times were so much different then.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: But without a car or - you know, I probably - like I told some of \u2018em, I said, \u201cI probably wasn\u2019t in the Marble Falls, which is 20 miles\u2026",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: \u201c\u2026over two or three times.\u201d",
        "DICKMEYER: Yeah.",
        "BUSHNELL: Same with Fredericksburg.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: And we went to Blanco once in a while with somebody. I don\u2019t know really, I don\u2019t remember all of it but\u2026 my dad had a Model T when the Depression started.",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: And I never will forget, he says, \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna sell this thing.\u201d He said, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford the gas for it.\u201d",
        "DICKMEYER: Right.",
        "BUSHNELL: So we sold it and we went - we had saddled horses and we had a wagon and team and that\u2019s how we travelled. And I think about the time that going to school up here there was wagons, and buggies, and horses\u2026",
        "DICKMEYER: Yeah.",
        "BUSHNELL: \u2026like there are cars today parked up there. But, uh, it was all just scary. I was scared when I got outside. I mean, I didn\u2019t know what to think when, you know, I got on that ship. Never been on a - never even thought about a ship. \u2018Course they told us that - some of those old timers said, \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s not much of a ship.\u201d He says, \u201cit\u2019s no Kaiser coffin.\u201d It was a cargo ship with a flat - with a flat deck and a\u2026",
        "DICKMEYER: Mhmm.",
        "BUSHNELL: \u2026a hangar deck made into an aircraft carrier. That\u2019s really what it was.",
