        "Admission to the Commercial Aviation Flight Operations program is highly competitive in order to ensure that admitted candidates not only meet the necessary qualifications but also exhibit the potential for extraordinary success in the field of aviation.",
        "For a candidate to be considered, the following requirements must be met.",
        "Additionally, to facilitate a fair evaluation, we employ a weighted assessment process that considers factors like GPA, ACT or SAT scores, and cognitive skills assessment results.",
        "After successfully applying and securing admission to ASU\u2019s commercial aviation program, candidates will receive communication from a program team membervia your @angelo.edu email accountto collect and confirm the submission of essential documents, including the Airman Medical Certificate, Driver\u2019s License, GPA, and SAT/ACT score.",
        "Once all these requirements are satisfied, the candidate will receive an email containing a link to purchase the Cognitive Skills Test (CST), which costs $40. After the purchase, the candidate will receive a unique key to access and complete the assessment. Upon finishing the CST, the resulting score will be shared with both the candidate and the Commercial Aviation program. The CST and the candidate\u2019s GPA and ACT (or SAT equivalent) determine the Flight Operations Acceptance Score (See theFlight Operations Acceptance Score Calculator).",
        "We use Symbiotics\u2019 Cognitive tests to gauge an individual\u2019s innate aptitude and cognitive capabilities relevant to aviation pursuits and learning. The assessments encompass various dimensions critical for aviation training success, including Verbal Reasoning, Numerical Reasoning, Working Memory, Perceptual Speed & Accuracy, Spatial Relationship Reasoning, and Abstract Reasoning.",
        "The test typically takes around 30 minutes to complete, and upon completion, candidates receive a score on a 100-point scale.",
        "We conduct a thorough and equitable evaluation of every applicant through our weighted assessment process that considers academic performance, standardized test scores, and cognitive aptitude in order to identify the most promising candidates with the potential for exceptional success in our program.",
        "* Scores are converted to a 100-point scale for use in the calculation.",
        "Achieving a Flight Operations Acceptance Score of84.13or higher prior to the application priority deadline guarantees automatic acceptance into the Flight Operations Concentration of the Commercial Aviation Program. For example, the following scores would produce an 84.13 score, which would guarantee acceptance:",
        "Applicants who do not meet this threshold will still be considered based on their ranking with other candidates to fill any remaining availability.",
        "Use the following calculator to determine your Flight Operations Acceptance Score.",
        "The priority application deadline for Fall 2025 was Dec. 13, 2024. While this date has passed, we encourage interested students to apply as soon as possible. The late application deadline for Fall 2025 has been extended to Feb. 28, 2025, and additional candidates will be considered based on their qualifications and the availability of spaces in the Flight Operations concentration.",
        "Students not initially admitted into the Flight Operations concentration will be placed on a waitlist. As openings become available, aviation program team members will notify the most competitive FOAS students about placement opportunities.",
        "Even if placed on the waitlist, students can begin their educational journey without delay by enrolling in the Aviation Administration concentration. This pathway allows students to take many relevant courses immediately, with the option to seamlessly transfer into the Flight Operations concentration if they are admitted from the waitlist or reapply in the following semester.",
        "Don\u2019t miss the opportunity to join the program\u2014submit your application today and take the first step toward your aviation career!",
        "For any questions or further assistance, reach out toaviation@angelo.edu.",
        "If you have any questions or need further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to the admissions office or contact the aviation program directly. We look forward to welcoming talented aviators like you into our program and helping you soar to new heights in your aviation career."
