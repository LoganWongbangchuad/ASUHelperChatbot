        "Dear ASU student,The faculty and staff at Angelo State are deeply interested in your academic and personal progress while you are a student here. It is our desire to see each student who enrolls here graduate from here and begin successful and meaningful professional careers. We have put in place many new support services and programs which are designed to assist you in achieving your potential both in and out of the classroom and we hope that you will take advantage of all that these programs have to offer.In keeping with our commitment to provide you with the resources needed to make informed decisions, I want to provide you with important information regarding illegal drug use and how it may impact your college career. The use of these drugs is unwise on many levels. Not only can they seriously hinder your academic performance, may disqualify you from entering certain career fields, and negatively affect your health, they may also impact your ability to attend college altogether.Angelo State University has historically taken a firm stance against the use of any illicit drugs. Should you be involved in any incident involving the use or possession of such drugs, you will you will be subject to University disciplinary action which may include you being required to leave the university. Moreover, should you be convicted in court of any incident involving the use or possession of these drugs and were receiving certain federal financial aid at the time of the offense, federal law mandates that you lose your eligibility for federal student financial aid and would have to meet certain requirements in order to have the aid reinstated in the future. The federal programs covered by this rule include the following: (1) Pell Grants, (2) Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), (3) Federal Direct Loans, (4) Perkins Loans, (5) Parent Plus Loans, (6) Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnerships (LEAP), and (7) Special Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnerships (SLEAP). Many of our students receive aid under one or more of these programs and are heavily dependent on it to pay for college.A detailed listing of the various health effects of illicit drugs, available counseling services, and legal sanctions for drug offenses under Texas law is available on theStudent Conduct website.If you have any questions concerning this issue, please contact the Office of Student Financial Aid at 325-942-2246 or the Office of Student Life at 325-942-2191."
