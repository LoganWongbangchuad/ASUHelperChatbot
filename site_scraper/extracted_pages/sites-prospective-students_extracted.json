        "It is our goal to be the premier civil engineering program in Texas. We will achieve this by producing practice-ready engineers with broad skills to be future leaders.",
        "Our graduates will leave ASU ready to pursue civil and mechanical engineering careers or prepared for graduate school, depending on their career aspirations.",
        "To meet the needs of employers, our students can expect to develop these skills and abilities while part of our program:",
        "Plus, we offer a wide variety of internship opportunities. About 60% of our students have engineering internship experience before they graduate.",
        "When you earn a civil engineering degree from ASU, you\u2019ll benefit from the following resources that have been secured for your student success:",
        "Our department has multiple endowed civil engineering scholarships that we can offer to our students.",
        "Civil engineering careers are broad and fast-growing, with a projected 20 percent job growth through 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
        "As the U.S. works to reverse a deficit in maintaining the infrastructure of bridges, roads, and water and power distribution plants, civil engineers will continue to be in high demand. Whether it\u2019s a power project, a highway project or a water distribution project, nothing gets built without civil engineers.",
        "On the commercial side, civil engineers can enjoy increases in development work. Now that the U.S. is coming out of the recession, there are more land development and construction projects gearing up.",
        "The mechanical engineering job market is quite varied as mechanical engineers can work in many type of industries and projects, Employment of mechanical Engineers is expected to grow 9 percent by 2026, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mechanical engineers will play an important role in the manufacturing industries, in particular in the automotive industry and the development of lower cost high range electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles. This is also true for the aeronautical industry that is facing new challenges every day.",
        "Mechanical engineers positions are projected to experience faster than average growth in engineering services. Mechanical engineers often work in the development of new devices and the automation of processes using robots. Emerging areas offering new opportunities for occupational growth are alternative energies and nanotechnology. Nanotechnology involves manipulating matter at the smallest levels and has application in healthcare and design of newer generation of computer chips",
        "Engineers work in large teams to get the job done. The engineering faculty strive to create welcoming classroom environments where you work with classmates in small class sizes and have easy access to engineering faculty. Getting involved is easy as there are numerous undergraduate student research and student organizations to join. Our students are hard at work bringing professional engineering student organizations to campus.",
        "The Engineering Council is a student group that is in the process of becoming an ASCE student chapter (American Society of Civil Engineers). The group plans to hold monthly meetings with local Professional Engineers as guest speakers in 2017-2018, and has already participated in the Texas-Mexico Student Symposium where they placed 3rd in the Concrete Bowling Ball Competition. The group\u2019s mission is to provide students in the David L. Hirschfeld Department of Engineering at ASU opportunities to develop leadership skills and become well-rounded individuals with the ability to adapt to our changing society and its environment.",
        "The 2017-2018 schedule will come out very soon, so check back for updates! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the chapter officers atengcouncil.angelo@gmail.com.",
        "You canfollow the student group on Facebook.",
        "An American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) student chapter is coming soon! In the meantime, you can join the national ASCE organization as a student member for free by visiting theASCE websiteand completing the registration process with your @angelo.edu email address.",
        "Our students are busy planning, designing, and building the inaugural Angelo State Steel Bridge entry to the 2018 ASCE Student Symposium where universities across Texas and Mexico compete for the regional title. The top finisher advances onto theNational Steel Bridge Competition.",
        "If you are interested to get involved with the Steel Bridge Team, stop by a Civil Engineering Council Meeting or contact the co-captains Ryan Albert (ralbert6@angelo.edu) or Josh Pirkle (jpirkle1@angelo.edu) for more information.",
        "The Civil Engineering Living Learning Community (LLC) offers students in Civil Engineering the opportunity to live in Plaza Verde along with other civil engineering students. The Student Learning Community Leader plans regular interactions and activities for the Living Learning Community.",
        "Contact the LLC Student Leader Abner Arteaga (aarteaga4@angelo.edu) or Engineering Academic Advisor (engineering@angelo.edu)for more information.",
        "You can also consider joining these national organizations as a paid (or free) student member:",
        "If you have an interest to create a student chapter associated with any of these national organizations, then please contact an engineering faculty member for more information.",
