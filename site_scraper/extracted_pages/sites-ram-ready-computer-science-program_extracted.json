        "Our partnership allows you to take intro-level computer science classes while still at your junior college. Once you\u2019ve completed your associate degree, you can take advantage of a seamless transition to Angelo State to finish your bachelor\u2019s degree.",
        "Our partnering institutions for this program are:",
        "Along with the student support services available at your home institution, you will also have access to the following services at Angelo State:",

        "ASU and the partner institution will work collaboratively to identify dates and times that will accommodate students\u2019 schedules and ability to participate synchronously.",
        "You will be charged the standard tuition and fees for the courses enrolled through your home institution. You will also be responsible for the tuition and fees for the course(s) enrolled through ASU. You will be required to pay account balances to each institution directly by the published deadlines and in accordance with the institution\u2019s payment policies. Students may receive a 1098-T Tuition Statement from both their home institution and ASU. The institutions will communicate to one another when a student has been dropped due to non-payment.",
        "Please Note: Federal regulations do not allow students to receive federal financial aid from two different institutions at the same time.",
        "However, Angelo State University and the partner Ram Ready Computer Science institutions have agreed to combine enrollment at both institutions for financial aid. Participating students are responsible for completing a Consortium Agreement at their community college (home institution). Students can attend their home institution and ASU during the same semester and receive federal financial aid funding through the Consortium Agreement. Financial aid is available for those who qualify.",
        "Students interested in Ram Ready Computer Science must be enrolled in a degree-seeking program and meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements determined by their home institution. Financial aid is disbursed according to the home institution disbursement schedule. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to pay all charges due to ASU. For example, if tuition and fees are due at ASU before financial aid is disbursed to the student account at the home institution, it is the student\u2019s responsibility to pay their ASU bill or make payment arrangements.",
