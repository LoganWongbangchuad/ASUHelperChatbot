        "The Space Allocation and Alteration Request Form (SAARF)",
        "Online SAARF Form",
        "This is the form you fill out when you want to make an alteration to the physical space of a building, or when you want to change how you will be using a room.",
        "This form tells us about a project where you plan to change the function of a room or rooms or you plan to alter the physical space of an area on campus. With this information, we can then update our inventory records with the state accurately so that THECB funding recommendations for our institution are fair and appropriate each year. Also, the Space Planning Coordinator will contact you with the next step to successfully complete your space need project.",
        "Fill out this form electronically or by hand, print, then obtain the necessary signatures.",
        "The form\u2019s final destination should be with theSpace Planning Coordinator.",
        "The Space Planning\u00a0 Coordinator is in charge of conducting the annual space survey to update the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) on facility changes. TheSpace Planning Coordinator\u2019s contact information is located here.",
        "Are you converting a closet into an office? Are you converting an office into research lab? If your plans to change space involve something like these two examples, you are changing the function of a room. Essentially people will now be using your room(s) for a different purpose.",
        "If you are moving to a different room that is not currently occupied by your college, you should select this choice. For example, the Norris-Vincent College of Business is wanting to house some faculty (office space needed) in rooms that were previously or are currently occupied by the College of Education.",
        "If you are moving to a different room that is not currently occupied by your department, you should select this choice. For example, the English Department wants to start holding classes in a class lab that is normally used by the History Department.",
        "This designation includes adding or moving walls and doors, addition of utilities or data ports (for internet), or the addition or removal of the physical space of a room.",
        "If our records of your rooms function, occupants, or anything else that we report to the state is inaccurate and there hasn\u2019t been any alteration of space or change of function recently, use this designation to let us know that we need to update our records. To see if your rooms are reported accurately, search through the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board\u2019s listing of our entireroom and building inventory.",
        "Your department\u2019s Space Representative is more than likely the head of your department (or your dean if you work directly for a dean). Your department\u2019s Space Representative may instruct you to work with the department\u2019s administrative assistant or secretary to fill out this form. The college\u2019s space representative is the dean or VP of your division. The college\u2019s space representative will best be able to judge whether your change will impact your college\u2019s space usage efficiency (and therefore funding recommendations provided by the state each year).",
        "Facilities Planning and Construction (FP&C) is the department that will help you contract a builder to make any room alterations (cabinetry, construction of walls and doors, counter tops, new building construction). If your plans include alteration of space, they may need you to fill out their Building Modification Form, which is located on theFP&C web site.",
        "As the project lead for the changes you are requesting, and the expert on your project, you are in charge of getting the required signatures for this form. Signatures are required in the order in which they are listed.\u00a0 Please contact theSpace Planning\u00a0Coordinatorif you have any questions about filling out this form or the signature section."
