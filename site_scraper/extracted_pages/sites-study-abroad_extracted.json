        "The Center for International Studies offers programs all around the world for both exchange semesters or years and faculty-led programs. The programs offered each year may vary. You can contact the Center for International Studies for an up-to-date list of exchange partner schools and faculty-led programs.",
        "A visa is a travel authorization document that allows you to enter a foreign country. You may or may not need a visa, depending on which country you intend to visit. The Center for International Studies staff can assist you in determining if you need a visa.",
        "Through careful planning and the help of the ASU Center for International Studies, studying abroad doesn\u2019t have to be very expensive. For example, in the academic semester or year programs, you pay ASU tuition and fees. You can use your existing scholarships and financial aid.",
        "All of our exchange programs offer courses in English. You may also choose to take language courses or courses taught in another language, but this is an optional aspect of studying abroad. Additionally, all faculty-led study abroad courses are taught in English.",
        "You can study just about anything abroad. You can take classes to satisfy general requirements or take courses as part of your major or minor.",
        "Yes. The Center for International Studies, your program director and your academic advisor will work with you to find the right courses that will fit into your degree plan. Usually, studying abroad will not keep you from graduating as planned.",
        "All students who participate in ASU-sponsored study abroad programs must purchase ASU\u2019s mandatory insurance policy. For more information, visit ourhealth and safety page.",
        "Each program varies, but the majority of programs take place at universities, so students reside in campus residence halls. Other travel may require hotels, hostels and other accommodations.",
        "It is definitely possible to study abroad in your senior year, but a few things must be taken into consideration. Just contact us and we will help you.",
        "Depending on the program, normally there are at least a few weekends when you will be able to travel on your own.",
        "The earlier you begin planning, the better, especially for the academic year programs. If you allow a year, you will have plenty of time to take care of all the logistical concerns, as well as improve your knowledge of the host language and culture. It takes time for applications to be processed, for travel arrangements to go through and for you to prepare yourself and your finances.",
        "Yes. Please note, though, that it can be a bit more complicated to fit study abroad into a graduate degree plan",
