        "TheCode of Student Conductoutlines behavioral standards developed by the university community for students and student organizations, as well as the related procedures for addressing misconduct. Students should be aware that the student conduct process is not a criminal or civil court proceeding. Students and student organizations are responsible for actions that constitute misconduct and violate theCode of Student Conduct. Any student or student organization found responsible for misconduct may be subject to conduct sanctions.",
        "TheCode of Student Conductand related processes educate students about their rights and responsibilities while promoting holistic development, self-worth and mutual respect for all members of the university community. Freedom of discussion, inquiry and expression are also fostered by an environment in which the privileges of citizenship are protected, and the obligations of citizenship are understood.",
        "The university\u2019s conduct procedure for students is outlined in the Angelo State University Student Handbook,Part I, Section B. The university\u2019s conduct procedure for student organizations is outlined inPart I, Section C."
