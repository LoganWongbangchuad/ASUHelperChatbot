        "The Angelo State University Department of Agriculture is proud to recognize Mrs. Darcy Weishuhn as the Outstanding Alumnus for 2021.",
        "Darcy Weishuhn, originally from Sterling City, Texas, who now resides in Wall with her husband Chase (also an Agriculture Department alum) and son Brooks, was inspired by the impact she saw growing up of a good banking relationship with the agriculture community leading her to the decision of going into the finance field. Her love of the agriculture community led her to Angelo State University and its Ag Department, where she graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Animal Business, now called Agribusiness, with a minor in finance. Weishuhn is currently the Vice President of Commercial Lending at The Bank and Trust after rising quickly through the ranks during her five years of service with the company.",
        "During her time at ASU, Weishuhn participated in numerous student organizations, including Delta Tau Alpha, National Society for Leadership and Success, Block and Bridle, Recruiting Ag Majors and the Agriculture Economics Quiz Bowl Team. Being able to travel and meet new people through these extracurriculars was an extremely valuable experience and went a long way in teaching her how to network. She also conducted undergraduate research on the cost effectiveness of xeriscaping vs. landscaping, which she presented to a committee in Washington, D.C. Following graduation, Weishuhn held a position as a loan officer at Crockett National Bank and 1st Community Federal Credit Union. She then got a position at The Bank and Trust, where she was given the opportunity to attend the Southwestern Graduate School of Banking at SMU, which she graduated from in 2019.",
        "Weishuhn values the people and friends she met through ASU the most and feels her time here really aided her ability to network with potential employers. Angelo State also exposed her to multiple opportunities to be involved in different organizations that helped further her career goals. Weishuhn is still connected to the university as she serves on multiple committees raising money for the Ag Department and ASU Ram Club Board of Directors. Outside of work, she is a member of the San Angelo Stock Show and Rodeo Premium Sale Committee, where she helps raise money to give as many kids as possible premiums for their animal projects.",
        "She encourages both current and future students to be involved in extracurricular activities since Angelo State University is a good-sized school that allows you to easily be involved in both major-related and non-major-related programs. She also emphasizes the importance of not forgetting everything the university has done for you once you have graduated and to stay involved and give back where you can."
