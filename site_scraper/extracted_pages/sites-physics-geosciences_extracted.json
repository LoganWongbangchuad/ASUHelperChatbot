Your ASU degree is your ticket to join an exciting world of professionals who make those discoveries, engineer new processes and inventions that improve our daily lives, and utilize and protect our natural resources. You could influence everything from military defense to medicine and from the energy industry to how we study the stars.",
        "Take a look at some other aspects of our department that make ASU an outstanding place to study physics and geosciences.",
        "You can take a variety of classes in our Planetarium. It\u2019s features the combination of a Sci-Dome HD digital projector and large tilted-dome theater. You can also check out free astronomy shows every week. Our other modern labs are highlighted by equipment like a Scanning Electron Microscope and LabVIEW software.",
        "Our Society of Physics Students is one of the most decorated chapters in the country. You can also join in the annual SPS Summer Road Tour and bring entertaining physics demonstrations to public schools around West Texas and New Mexico. Geosciences students can join the Geologic Exhibition Organization (GEO).",
        "Physics students visit scientific facilities like the Pickle Nuclear Lab in Austin. Geosciences students visit geologic sites in the Big Bend and Permian Basin. We can also help you set up internships for valuable hands-on experience.",
