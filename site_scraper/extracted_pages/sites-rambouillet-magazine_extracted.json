        "The Pride of Angelo State University",
        "The Rambouillet magazine is the annual publication for Angelo State University that is mailed out to ASU alumni and friends each fall.",
        "The Rambouillet covers the previous year\u2019s accomplishments for the institution, highlighting student, faculty, staff and alumni success. It also includes features about current and upcoming programs, a recap of the year in ASU athletics, and profiles of the Alumni Association\u2019s annual Homecoming honorees, as well as details about generous contributions from Angelo State friends and donors.",
        "The Rambouillet is published by the ASU Office of Communications and Marketing.",
        "As some of you may remember, \u201cRambouillet\u201d was previously the title of ASU\u2019s yearbook until it was discontinued in 1993. The current iteration began as the ASU Alumni Magazine that was published by the Alumni Association until 2006. It was then transferred under the auspices of the Office of News and Publications (now the Office of Communications and Marketing) and was published three times a year.",
        "Beginning in 2008, the title was changed to ASU Magazine, and while alumni news and accomplishments continued to be featured, the focus of the publication shifted more to the university as a whole. With new management in the Office of Communications and Marketing arriving in 2014, the magazine became an annual publication and the title was changed to the Rambouillet as a nod to tradition, beginning with the 2015 edition."
