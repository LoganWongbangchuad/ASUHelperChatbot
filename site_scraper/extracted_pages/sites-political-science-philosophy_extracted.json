        "Pi Sigma Alpha is a national honor society created specifically for students and faculty members in the fields of government and political science. It is an accredited member society of the Association of College Honor Societies, ranking as the third largest member.",
        "Our chapter strives to stimulate scholarship and intelligent interest in political science; to provide for the academic recognition of inductees; and to organize and conduct national and international seminars, conferences, research, discussion groups, study groups and publications in the area of political science.",
        "Pi Sigma Alpha was founded by C. Perry Patterson at the University of Texas in Austin in 1920. The first national convention was held at the University of Oklahoma in 1922. Growth of the society boomed in the years following World War II, and today more than 460 chapters are active throughout the United States, including at least one in each state, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territory of Guam.",
        "In 1997, Angelo State University established its own branch of Pi Sigma Alpha, which was officially titled the Phi Mu Chapter by the national organization. Former San Angelo State Rep. Rob Junell and former San Angelo Mayor Col. Johnny C. Fender were inducted as honorary members of ASU\u2019s Phi Mu Chapter in 1998 and 2001, respectively.",
        "The society functions at the chapter and national levels by sponsoring programs and events of value to the profession and teaching of political science. Each chapter is encouraged to provide a framework for enriching the exposure of its members and the wider university community to the study of political science and issues of public concern. Pi Sigma Alpha seeks to promote excellence in the study of political science through a variety of programs, some of direct benefit to student members and local chapters and others targeted more generally at the profession of political science.",
        "Students qualify if they:",
        "Lifetime membership brings you a number of benefits, all for only a $30 one-time fee to the national society, plus a $10 one-time fee to the local chapter (Phi Mu) to help cover the operational needs of the chapter.",
