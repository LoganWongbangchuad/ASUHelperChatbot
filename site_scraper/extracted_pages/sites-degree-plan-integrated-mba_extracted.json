        "Students interested in the Integrated B.S. in Agribusiness/M.B.A. in Business Administration will be required to complete a minimum of 150 semester credit hours of degree credit. Of this total, 120 semester credit hours will be at the undergraduate level and 30 semester credit hours will be at the graduate level. A unique feature of the five-year program is that students will begin taking graduate course work in their senior year. All candidates for this program are required to take the GMAT and be admitted to the Graduate Program before taking any graduate credit hours. The student must maintain a cumulative 3.00 in all undergraduate courses and a cumulative 3.00 in all graduate courses. Another unique feature of this program will be the awarding of the B.S. in Agribusiness and M.B.A in Business Administration degrees simultaneously at the completion of the program. Therefore, a student will not be awarded the B.S. in Agribusiness after completing 120 semester credit hours at the undergraduate level until the completion of the 30 semester credit hours at the graduate level in the M.B.A. in Business Administration. Should a student decide not to finish the M.B.A. portion of the program, then this student would be required to complete all of the course requirements to finish the B.S. in Agribusiness as a separate degree.",
