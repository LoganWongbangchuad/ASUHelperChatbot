        "Angelo State University\u2019s strategic plan,\u201cEnvisioning 100 Years & Beyond\u201d, July 2019, was the result of over 12 months of planning and dialogue about the fundamental direction of the university for the 21st century. Continuing on the foundation laid through Vision 2020, ASU seeks to expand efforts for retention, recruitment, student and faculty/staff success, and continuous improvement. The strategic plan, aligning with the mission, is designed with our institutional vision and values; ASU will continue to be distinguished by our teaching, research, and student-centered environment.",
        "Vision 2020The precursor to \u201cEnvisioning 100 Years & Beyond\u201d,Vision 2020 (Third Edition, Spring 2017)was initiated in July 2010 and was re-envisioned with a third iteration in Spring 2017 with the addition of SACSCOC standard updates and the institutions success in meeting most of the Vision 2020 goals. The document clearly illustrated the centrality of the academic program through its goals.",
        "Vision 2012The precursor to Vision 2020, Vision 2012 was initiated in the summer of 2007 as it began the process of strategic planning. Originally entitled \u201cTransformational Expectations: Vision 2012,\u201d this initiative resulted in the first round of discussions about mission, vision, and core values."
