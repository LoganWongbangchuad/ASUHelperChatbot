        "Despite being in a war, Ricks, like many soldiers, took the opportunity to record the once-in-a-lifetime trip for a small-town farmer through photographs.",
        "Born in 1922, George Wesley Ricks was a farmer from Cisco, Texas. He enlisted in the U.S. Army during Word War II and served as a cook in the 222nd Infantry Regiment as it marched its way across France and Germany, eventually participating in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He photographed his wartime travels, including all the new and different places he saw that were nothing like his small hometown.",
        "His collection of photographs includes stunning landscapes, historical buildings and a souvenir photo of him and friends in New York\u2019s Times Square.",
