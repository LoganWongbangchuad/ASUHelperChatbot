        "Several grant awards continue to strengthen the academic and student support areas at ASU with the impact of changing family trees.",
        "In 2021, ASU was awarded a $199,597National Science Foundation(NSF) grant, through theDivision of Equity for Excellence in STEM(EES). This research grant focuses on the reasons why students choose to enter into and leave STEM education.",
        "This grant is part of a series of grants through the NSF EES that works to increase participation of students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM, with the ultimate goal of developing and maintaining a diverse and highly capable STEM workforce, leading to innovation and sustaining U.S. competitiveness in the science and engineering fields.",
        "We\u2019ve used a mix of interviews and surveys to understand what parents, students and faculty think about STEM education, with the goal of increasing student engagement within STEM fields at ASU and creating better relationships with the community. To date, we have surveyed over 250 ASU students in both STEM fields and non-STEM fields, as well as 200 parents and community members, and have conducted almost 30 interviews and 10 focus groups.",
        "Some key findings include:",
        "Read the News Release",
        "Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.",
        "TheCREEME (Culturally Responsive EducationEnMechanical Engineering)project received funding in 2017 from the U.S. Department of Education HSI Title V program. This award established the Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (B.S.M.E.) program, created the faculty and staff culturally relevant pedagogy training program, and redesigned policies and systems that remove challenges related to transferring to ASU.",
        "Through the culturally relevant pedagogy program, CREEME ensures that Hispanic, first-generation and/or low-income students receive a set of more culturally sustaining experiences than they would at other institutions. This is accomplished through the adoption of culturally relevant teaching practices, re-imaging curricular pedagogies, and redefining the processes and systems the university utilizes in collaborating with community colleges to improve teaching, advising and relationships with community college partners.",
        "TheSTEP West Texas (Strengthening the Engineering Pipeline in West Texas)project received funding from the U.S. Department of Education HSI Division from 2014-19. It aimed to solve several problems in the 35-county areas served by ASU and Southwest Texas Junior College (a two-year institution with campuses in Uvalde, Del Rio, Eagle Pass and Crystal City) by addressing the lack of a civil engineering program at any institution of higher education in the region; a continuing and growing high demand for civil engineers, and limited resources to develop such a program.",
        "Through this partnership, community college students can obtain an Associate of Science in Engineering Sciences (A.S.E.S.) degree before transferring to ASU to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (B.S.C.E.) degree."
