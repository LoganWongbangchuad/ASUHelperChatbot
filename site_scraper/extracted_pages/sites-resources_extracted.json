        "The word \u201cbufo\u201d means toad in Latin. It was used as the genus name for toads all over the world by Linnaeus in the 1700s. More recently (particularly in 2006), scientists have realized that not all toads are closely related to each other. To recognize the differences among toads in the Americas, they have been placed into different genera, includingAnaxyrus,RhinellaandIncilius. We includedBufoin parentheses because many biologists (including teachers) learned the nameBufoand may not recognizeAnaxyrus.",
