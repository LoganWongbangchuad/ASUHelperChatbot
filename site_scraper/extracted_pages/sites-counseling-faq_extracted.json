        "TheCounseling Services Buildingis located between the museum, clock tower, and the chapel.",
        "A good rule of thumb is if you have tried to make positive changes in your life and have not succeeded to a satisfactory level, you might want to try talk therapy. Most people find counseling to be beneficial in improving life satisfaction, but therapy also comes with risks such as uncomfortable feelings and the difficulty of change.",
        "Counseling Services is funded by the Medical Services Fee. Most students are assessed the medical services fee as part of their tuition and fees and therefore are able to receive Counseling Services and medical services at theUniversity Clinic. In the event a student has not been assessed the fee, they mayopt-into utilize the services.",
        "Counseling Services does not accept money or payments for any services. Students may utilize Counseling Services as long as the Medical Services Fee has been added to their account.",
        "Absolutely! It would be illegal for Counseling Services to share information from a counseling session with your professors, parents, peers, or anyone else. No client information goes on your academic record and information is not released to anyone outside of Counseling Services without written consent from the student or as prescribed by law in the below situations:",
        "1) Abuse of children, elderly, or disabled persons.2) Imminent harm to self.3) Imminent harm to others.4) Reports of exploitation by a former therapist.5) Court orders for records release, depositions, and testimony.",
        "The quickest way is get in to see a counselor is to walk-into the Center during out intake hours, from 9am \u2013 3pm, Monday \u2013 Friday. If you would like to reserve a specific appointment time, you may give us a call at 325-942-2371 or use ourOnline Scheduling Request.",
        "Our counselors are licensed mental health professionals in the state of Texas that are trained to treat mental health disorders ranging from mild to severe. We also have social work and counseling graduate practicum students that treat clients under the supervision of a licensed therapist.",
        "Your first appointment will take about 60-90 minutes. When you arrive at Counseling Services, you will receive a tablet to complete some background information. Your counselor will review the history you provided and take you back to their office to identify the reasons you came to counseling and collaborate with you to develop an individualized treatment plan to meet your goals.",
        "You will be sent a link the first thing in the morning on the day of your teletherapy appointment to complete your paperwork. Once your information has been received you will receive an invitation for a virtual appointment or a telephone call based on the preference you specified. During the meeting you will collaborate with your therapist to develop an individualized treatment plan to meet your goals.",
        "Not every counselor and client are going to be a perfect fit for each other. If you did not have a great connection with your therapist, please let our front office staff know at 325-942-2371 orcounselingservices@angelo.eduso we can try to find a better match for you.",
        "Counseling Services offers several therapy options, including Single Session Therapy. Single session therapy is primarily for those with a very specific question, want assistance on a single problem, or who want guidance about their concern for others."
