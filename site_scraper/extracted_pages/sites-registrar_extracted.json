A full course load for graduate assistants or teaching assistants is six to nine hours.An undergraduate student in good academic standing (2.0 GPA or better) may register for a maximum of 18 semester credit hours. Students with a GPA of 3.0 or better may be approved for a maximum of 20 semester credit hours by the head of their academic major department or by the appropriate college dean. Approval for course loads larger than the stated maximums may be given by the appropriate college dean only in exceptional situations and when the student has a grade point average of 3.50 or higher.A graduate student in good academic standing (3.0 GPA or better) may register for a maximum of 12 semester credit hours per semester. In exceptional situations, graduate students with a 3.5 GPA or better on all graduate course work attempted at ASU may request to register for a maximum of 15 semester credit hours in the semester in which they will graduate. The request should be made through the College of Graduate Studies and Research dean\u2019s office.
