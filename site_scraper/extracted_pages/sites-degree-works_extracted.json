        "DegreeWorks is an accessible and user-friendly advisement tool located within ASU\u2019s RamPort portal, providing students and advisors with an organized outlook on degree plan evaluations. Aimed to help the student progress through his or her degree plan efficiently, DegreeWorks compares the student\u2019s academic history with the degree requirements outlined in the University catalog.",
        "Undergraduate and Graduate students can use DegreeWorks, as well as the advising faculty/staff from different departments and the Registrar\u2019s Office.",
        "No. Registration will continue to be accessed through RamPort.",
        "A DegreeWorks audit is a review of past, current, and planned coursework that provides information on completed and outstanding catalog requirements necessary to complete a degree. The audit is divided into block requirements such as Degree, Major, Major Support Courses, Core, and other requirements (dependent upon the program). Each block works like a checklist that has boxes that are automatically checked when a requirement is met.",
        "The information in DegreeWorks is refreshed nightly. Any changes made today will be seen in DegreeWorks the next day.",
        "There could be many reasons why information in DegreeWorks is not up to date. One is that DegreeWorks may not have been refreshed since a change was made (information is refreshed nightly) to a student record. Second, there could be some paperwork that must be completed. For example, if a change in major is pending, it is possible the form has not reached the appropriate college. Check with your academic advisor/academic college regarding information not being up to date.",
        "Yes. Once grades have been posted at the end of the semester or term, they are viewable in DegreeWorks.",
        "Yes. Click on the \u201cClass History\u201d link at the top for a list of courses taken at Angelo State University as well as transfer courses. This is not an official transcript.",
        "No. Contact your academic advisor on how to change your major/minor/concentration.",
        "Your audit will outline courses needed to meet degree, major, minor, and/or concentration requirements within each specific block. You may then use this information to discuss your plan with your Academic Advisor.",
        "Please ask your academic advisor for assistance. The first step is to clarify what information you believe is wrong. These are the most common problems and courses of action:",
        "A degree audit can be reviewed at any time; however, it is recommended to do so at least four times a semester. You should always review your audit:",
        "Your degree audit is a tool to provide you with academic information related to your degree progress. It displays courses required and completed in your degree program. Your transcript is your official university academic record and provides a chronological list of courses completed and other academic information.",
        "This is a wild card in DegreeWorks. If the @ sign appears with course numbers after it (i.e., @3000:4999), it means that you can take any subject area with that level (3000-4000 level course from any subject area). If it appears after a subject prefix (i.e., CRIJ @), it means that you can take any course with that subject prefix (any course in Criminal Justice).",
        "Transfer grades coded as TD do not count towards degree requirements.",
        "Please contact your academic advisor"

        "My major is wrong on my audit.If you have not officially changed your major, contact your academic advisor. If you have already officially changed your major, the DegreeWorks audit will only display your active degree audit. If your change is effective for a future term, the change may not reflect until that term.",
        "The requirements for my major are wrong.Look at the catalog term that appears in the header area of the audit. According to our records this is the catalog that you are using to complete your major requirements. If you believe you should be using an older or newer catalog, contact your Academic Advisor.",
        "My transfer courses do not appear in the right place.If you are concerned about a transfer course that should be applying in the audit, contact your academic advisor.",
        "Classes are not applying in the right place.DegreeWorks uses a \u2018best fit\u2019 approach for meeting requirements so classes may apply to different sections as you take more courses. If you have further questions, please contact your academic advisor.",
        "My advisor or department chair gave me permission to substitute a course, but it\u2019s not showing on my audit.Speak with your academic dean\u2019s office. They enter an exception (substitution) to the standard requirements. Once exceptions are entered by the dean\u2019s office and a new audit has been run, the change will appear on the audit.",
        "My minor or concentration is missing from my audit.If you have not officially declared your minor or concentration, contact your academic advisor for instructions. If you have already officially declared your minor, your academic dean\u2019s office may still be updating your records.",
