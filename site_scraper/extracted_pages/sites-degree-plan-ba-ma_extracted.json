        "Students interested in the Integrated B.A./M.A. in English will be required to complete a minimum of 150 semester credit hours of degree credit. Of this total, 120 semester credit hours will be at the undergraduate level and 30 semester credit hours will be at the graduate level. The undergraduate course requirements are identical to those for the non-integrated B.A. except for the substitution of two 5000-level undergraduate courses that willintroduce students to graduate study.",
        "Candidates for this program must meet the current admission requirementsfor the M.A. program and be unconditionally admitted before taking any graduate level courses. The student must achieve a cumulative GPA of 3.00or better in all undergraduate courses and a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or better in all graduate courses.",
        "A unique feature of the integrated program is that the student will begin taking graduate course work in his/her senior year. Upon successful completion of all 150 semester credit hours of this five-year program, the student will be awarded both the B.A. and M.A. degree at the same time; the student will not receive the B.A. in English after completing the 120 semester credit hours at the undergraduate level. Should a student decide not to complete the M.A. portion of the integrated program, then this student would have to complete any remaining degree requirements for the B.A. in English in order to be awarded that degree. All of the undergraduate courses alreadycompleted as part of the integrated five-year program would count towardscompletion of the B.A. in English.",
