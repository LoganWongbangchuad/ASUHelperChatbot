        "Please Note:ESAs are not permitted on campus until they are approved.",
        "Provide documentation verifying diagnosis AND the need for an Emotional Support Animal from an off-campus medical provider licensed in Texas. This documentation should come from a student\u2019s primary mental health care provider.",
        "Student Disability Services discourages paying individuals found on websites for certificates or template letters. As per the guidance document by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD):",
        "Some websites sell certificates, registrations, and licensing documents for assistance animals to anyone who answers certain questions or participates in a short interview and pays a fee.",
        "In HUD\u2019s experience, such documentation from the internet is not, by itself, sufficient to reliably establish that an individual has a non-observable disability or disability-related need for an assistance animal.",
        "Contact usfor more information.",
        "An Emotional Support Animal (sometimes referred to as an assistance animal) is an animal needed for emotional support. Federal law allows individuals with disabilities the presence of a broader range of animals (\u201cassistance animals\u201d) in University housing as compared with the campus as a whole.",
        "\u201cESA types are typically animals commonly kept in households. Examples include but are not limited to a dog, cat, small bird, rabbit, hamster, gerbil, other rodent, fish, turtle, or other small, domesticated animal that is traditionally kept in the home\u201d.(hud.gov)",
        "In general, reptiles, other than turtles, barnyard animals and exotic animals are not considered household pets. If the individual is requesting to keep a unique type of animal that is not commonly kept in households as described above, then the requester has the substantial burden of demonstrating a disability-related, therapeutic need for the specific type of animal. The individual is encouraged to submit documentation from a healthcare professional confirming the need for this unique type of animal.",
        "To request to have an ESA in on-campus housing, a student must complete the accommodation request process with Student Disability Services. The student must have a recognized disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and show that the request for an ESA is a reasonable accommodation that is directly related to their disability needs.",
        "Documentation must indicate how the ESA alleviates one or more of the identified symptoms or effects of an existing disability.",
        "The University is not responsible for the care or supervision of an assistance animal.",
        "Individuals with disabilities are solely responsible for the care, supervision, and control of their assistance animal at all times, and for ensuring the immediate clean-up and proper disposal of all animal waste.",
        "Individuals must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including vaccination, licensure, animal health and leash laws, as well as the University\u2019s rules in lease provisions regarding vaccination, licensure, leash control, cleanup rules, animal health, and community relationships.",
        "Students with ESAs are responsible for the charges associated with cleaning the room, pest control, or damages necessary to return the room to the same condition as before the animal was brought to campus. The student will be required to sign a Rights and Responsibilities Acknowledgement before being approved to bring the animal to campus housing.",
        "No. While ESAs are often used as part of a medical treatment plan, they are not considered Service Animals under the ADA. However, they are viewed as a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d under the Fair Housing Act (FHA) in those housing communities that have a \u201cno pets\u201d rule.",
        "Service animals are defined as dogs (or miniature horses in limited situations) that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. The work or task a service animal does must be directly related to the person\u2019s disability. Service animals may accompany persons with disabilities into places that the public normally goes.",
        "An ESA generally provides assistance and/or emotional support to persons with disabilities who have a disability-related need for such support. While dogs are the most common type of ESA, other animals can also be ESAs. The animal need not be specifically trained to perform tasks for a person who has a mental health or medical disability. Unlike a service animal, an ESA is not granted access to all places of public accommodation. As noted above, under the FHA, an ESA is viewed as a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d in a housing unit.",
        "ESAs are generally only allowed in the dwelling (housing environment) of students and places that any animal is allowed in public. ESAs are typically not allowed in other campus buildings, including academic buildings, the Library, the University Center, and The CAF. If you have specific questions about where an ESA is permitted in the housing environment, please consult with Student Disability Services.",
        "ESAs should not be brought into on-campus housing until approved by Student Disability Services.",
        "\u201cReasonably supporting information often consists of information from a licensed health care professional \u2013 e.g., physician, optometrist, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician\u2019s assistant, nurse practitioner, or nurse \u2013 general to the condition but specific as to the individual with a disability and the assistance or therapeutic emotional support provided by the animal. A relationship or connection between the disability and the need for the assistance animal must be provided.\u201d (hud.gov).",
        "Complete documentation will be reviewed in the order received and eligibility will be determined as quickly as possible. Placement timeframe is based on availability of housing space and roommate consent.",
        "The steps to follow before the ESA request process is complete:",
        "Please note that if an ESA request is not approved, Student Disability Services staff will contact the student to request additional documentation and/or provide rationale.",
        "Service animals are defined as dogs (or miniature horses in rare instances) that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities.",
        "Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a service animal has been trained to do must be directly related to the person\u2019s disability.",
        "Animals whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.",
        "Service animals are allowed to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of a facility where the public is normally allowed to go.",
        "Some restrictions may be appropriate, however, if the presence of the animal would compromise the integrity of the setting.",
        "Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal\u2019s work or the individual\u2019s disability prevents using these devices. In these cases, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal or other effective controls at all times.",
        "When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions:",
        "Staff cannot ask about the person\u2019s disability, require medical documentation or training documentation for the animal, or ask for a demonstration of the ability to perform the work or task.",
        "Allergies and fear are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals.",
        "When a person who is allergic to dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.",
        "A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his or her animal from the premises unless one of these conditions exists:",
        "When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal\u2019s presence."
