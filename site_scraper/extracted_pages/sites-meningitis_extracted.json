        "Bacterial meningitis is a serious, potentially deadly disease that can progress extremely fast. It is an inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. A bacterium that causes meningitis can also infect the blood. This disease strikes about 3,000 Americans each year, including students on 100\u2013125 college campuses, leading to 5\u201315 deaths among college students every year. Treatment for the disease is available, but those who survive may still develop severe health problems or disabilities.",
        "Those infected may develop anywhere on the body a rash of tiny, red-purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin. The more symptoms, the higher the risk, so when these symptoms appear, seek immediate medical attention.",
        "Diagnosis is made by a medical provider, and is usually based on a combination of clinical symptoms and laboratory results from spinal fluid and blood tests.",
        "Early diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve the likelihood of recovery.",
        "The disease is transmitted when people exchange saliva (by engaging in activities such as kissing or sharing drink containers, utensils, cigarettes, toothbrushes, etc.) or come into contact with respiratory or throat secretions.",
        "In addition to engaging in activities in which saliva is exchanged, another increased risk is living in close conditions, such as a shared room/suite in a residence hall or group home.",
        "Antibiotic treatment, if received early, can save lives and increase chances of recovery. However, permanent disability or death can still occur.",
        "More information is also available on these websites:"
