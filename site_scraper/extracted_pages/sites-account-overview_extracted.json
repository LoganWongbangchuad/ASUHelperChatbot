        "Angelo State University has partnered with BankMobile to deliver your financial aid refund.",
        "The BankMobile Vibe checking account is a digital-only, FDIC-insured checking account with access to 55,000 fee-free Allpoint\u00ae ATMs, money management tools and a one-of-a-kind recognition program. You can continue to use this account when you are no longer a student, and BankMobile also offers an interest-bearing savings account.",
        "A few of the benefits include:",
        "For more information about the Optional BankMobile Vibe Account, visitasuone.com.",
        "You can use your ASU OneCard and BankMobile Vibe Account anywhere Debit MasterCard is accepted \u2013 more than 31 million locations worldwide.",
        "Insert or swipe the card as indicated and follow the directions on the screen. When prompted for a transaction type, choose Checking Account Withdrawal. Remember, you have fee-free access to over 55,000 Allpoint\u00ae Network\u00a0ATMs\u00a0worldwide-plus Customers Bank\u00a0ATMs. If you use another ATM, you will be subject to a fee by the ATM owner.",
        "Banks charge other banks a fee each time they allow the other bank\u2019s customers to use their ATMs. These fees may vary in amounts. If possible, use an Allpoint\u00ae Network ATM or Customers Bank ATM. For a listing of all Allpoint\u00ae Network ATMs, log in to your BankMobile Vibe Account and search Easy Help for ATM Locations.",
        "The total amount of funds you can spend in a day using your card is $3,000: $500 in ATM withdrawals and $2,500 at a merchant or bank teller. The $2,500 may be in a combination of debit card swipe-and-sign, PIN transactions, or cash advance at a bank teller. BankMobile does not charge a cash advance withdrawal fee, which means that students can walk into any bank branch and withdraw cash without a fee from BankMobile.",
        "On some occasions, if parts of the technology systems are down, the daily limits may be lower. If you need to make a special purchase with your card that exceeds the daily limit, contact a customer service representative at 1-877-278-1919.",
        "Your available balance equals your current balance plus or minus any holds or pending transactions. For example, there are usually a few days between the time merchants receive authorization to withdraw funds and when they actually do it. During this time, funds to cover the anticipated amount of the transaction are held. Another example is for paper check deposits. It takes time from the date the check is deposited for the bank from which the check is drawn to release the funds. During this time, all of the deposit may not be available to spend.",
        "Deposits to your BankMobile Vibe Account are available as soon as\u00a0BankMobile collects the money and, in some cases, sooner. For each type of deposit, the speed at which the money can be collected is different. For incoming wires and direct deposits of payroll or university refunds, the money is available immediately. However, if you deposit a paper check to your account, the full amount will not be available until the funds are released by the bank on which the check is written. As a courtesy, the first $100 of your check-based deposits will be available the next business day \u2013 this is money that is being made available to you before the other bank has released the funds. For more details on the exact schedule, see the Funds Availability Policy atasuone.com.",
        "When you use your card at merchant establishments, they usually ask the bank if there is enough money available to cover the purchase. If the transaction is approved, a pending debit will be placed on your BankMobile Vibe Account for the amount of the purchase. This pending card transaction does not yet contain details on the name or location of the merchant. When the merchant processes or completes the transaction, the amount of the purchase is debited from your BankMobile Vibe Account.",
        "In general, your\u00a0 BankMobile Vibe Account is designed to reduce the chances of an overdraft, but it is possible in some cases to overdraw your account. For questions or inquiries about your BankMobile Vibe Account and any transactions, contact a customer service representative at 1-877-278-1919.",
        "Even when you are no longer a student at ASU, you can continue to use your ASU OneCard and BankMobile Vibe Account through the expiration date printed on the front of your card. If you decide that this option is not for you, call\u00a0BankMobile customer service at 1-877-278-1919.",
        "If you cannot remember either your log-in name (email address) or your password, contact\u00a0BankMobile customer service at 1-877-278-1919.",
        "If you remember your log-in name but not your password, you can reset your password atasuone.comor you can contact BankMobile customer service at 1-877-278-1919.",
        "To\u00a0report a claim on\u00a0a transaction, please determine if it has posted to your account as an actual charge (and not a pending transaction). Unfortunately, pending card transactions do not yet contain details (like the identifier, name, and location of the merchant) that are required to initiate a claim.",
        "If you suspect that the pending card transactions are unauthorized, you will want to protect your account by canceling your card. Once the transactions post, you may\u00a0initiate a claim on\u00a0them and contact Customer Care for a free card.",
        "If the transaction gets posted to your account as an actual charge, click on the \u201c+\u201d sign at the top left corner of the relevant line transaction(s) on your online statement. This action will further expand the line transaction with a short description of how it was performed and most importantly, provide the opportunity to\u00a0report a claim on\u00a0the transaction if it is one you do not recognize or did not authorize.You will be prompted to answer questions related to your\u00a0claim and also required to provide detailed information regarding the circumstances surrounding the\u00a0transaction in which you are\u00a0initiating a claim on. A\u00a0claim number will be assigned to you at the end process. If it becomes necessary to download a\u00a0claim form, you should submit your\u00a0completed form\u00a0as quickly as possible. If \u201cunauthorized\u201d activity is reported,\u00a0BankMobile may choose to cancel your card to prevent further possible fraud and abuse.If it becomes necessary, you can also contact Customer Care for assistance at the toll-free number listed on the back of your card between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m. EST (Monday to Friday).Please note that\u00a0claims can take up to 90 days to be resolved. However while it remains open for investigation, you will receive an email notification every 15 days informing you that the matter is still being researched. Unfortunately, a determination cannot be made on the fees associated with a\u00a0reported claim\u00a0transaction until the\u00a0claim process is complete and has been ruled in your favor.",
        "You may also fax your claim forms to the Claim Fax Number at 1-877-504-1999. If you do not have access to a fax or need to mail supporting documentation to BankMobile, please come to the OneCard Office in the General Services Building. We will be glad to fax or mail the information for you at no cost."
