        "Since it first began awarding scholarships in 1981, the Carr Foundation has provided more than $86 million to help students pay for college at Angelo State University. The foundation was made possible by Robert G. Carr and his wife, Nona K. Carr, who bequeathed their interests in oil, gas and other minerals from producing properties in West Texas. The Carrs made significant financial provisions for ASU as an expression of their confidence in the faculty and administration of the university.",
        "We encourage you to use the Carr Foundation website to learn more about the Carrs and their generosity, as well as the foundation that has helped so many students throughout the years.",
