        "Tuition Assistance (TA) is your best option if you plan to attend Angelo State while on active duty, though there may be other options available to you.",
        "The military and other government services manage their TA programs differently, so there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d counsel we can provide with respect to the use of Tuition Assistance.",
        "You should always start any quest for higher education (or certification) at your supporting base education center. You should also seek pre-authorization from your educational services officers and chain of command prior to registration and enrollment. Your supporting base education center should be able to make certain you are doing your TA request correctly, and your chain of command should know if you will have any competing time requirements during the upcoming semesters.",
        "Once your education path has been approved by your chain of command and base education center, you will register for classes. Then, when you are in the \u201cwindow\u201d to apply for TA, you will use your service\u2019s education portal to submit a funding request. These \u201cwindows\u201d of opportunity vary based on your service\u2019s regulations, but tend to be between 7-45 days before the beginning of the semester.",
        "Ensure you have all the correct data for your TA funding request, including course data, name, start and stop dates, and costs. The final product of a TA funding request is a PDF of a TA Authorization Form, which is typically downloaded directly from your service\u2019s portal.",
        "For more information about TA, based on your service\u2019s policies, please check with your designated base education center. The ASUVETS Centercan also provide some informational help, but each service has slightly different rules and regulations.",
        "Angelo State offers Tuition Assistance (TA) Scholarships for active-duty service members who submit a valid and correct Tuition Assistance Authorization Form to cover TA-approved courses.",
        "Our TA Scholarship will cover the difference between total TA and other gift aid* benefits and the actual cost of tuition and fees.",
        "ASU doesn\u2019t cover elective fees (like parking passes), punitive fees (like parking fines), books and school supplies, aviation access fee, aviation instructional flight fees, cancellation (reinstatement) fee, graduate internship fee, hospital and healthcare facility administration fee and installment plan fee or late fee. These are your responsibility.",
        "A non-degree seeking, transient student does not qualify for the TA Scholarship. This is incompliance withFederal Aid General Eligibility Requirements",
        "*Gift aid includes grants and scholarships other than the Angelo State TA Scholarship. All gift aid will be used to reduce the cost of tuition and fees for approved courses after TA funds have been applied. If a balance is due after the application of TA funds and all other gift aid, we will cover the remaining balance with TA Scholarship funds. If you have sufficient gift aid to cover all amounts due after the application of TA, then TA Scholarship funds will not be applied.",
        "** While the FAFSA will provide you the opportunity to take out student loans, we do not require (nor do we want) you to approve or take any of these.",
        "We encourage all students to apply for financial aid. Even though you receive Tuition Assistance or other military benefits, you may also qualify for financial aid.",
        "We offer more than600 scholarship programsthrough the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships.",
        "Hopefully, in the pre-authorization process, your chain of command will inform you of any upcoming exercises or deployments. However, we understand that \u201cthings\u201d happen in the military. If you get short-notice orders (for training, deployment or other temporary duty) that will prevent the successful completion of your academic endeavors for the semester, please contact our VETS Center atvets@angelo.edu. We will work with you to meet the requirements of your orders and the needs of the university.",
        "Per DoD MOU, paragraph 3.i.(1), institutions are required to \u201chave a re-admission policy for service members that allows service members and reservists to be re-admitted to a program if they are temporarily unable to attend class or have to suspend their studies due to service requirements.\u201d",
        "Normally, any undergraduate student who misses a long semester (either spring or fall) or any graduate student who misses one year will be dis-enrolled from the university and must complete a Returning Student Application to re-enroll. A service member who is required to miss a long semester because of service requirements only needs to complete theReturning Student Active Duty Military Application Fee Waiver.This administrative requirement is free."
