        "An individual who experiences sexual misconduct is encouraged to seek medical care for treatment and preservation of evidence, if applicable, as soon as practical after the incident. Preserving DNA evidence can be key to identifying the perpetrator in a sexual violence case. Victims can undergo a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE) performed by a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) to preserve physical evidence, with or without police involvement. If possible, this should be done immediately. If an immediate medical exam is not possible, a SANE may still collect evidence several days following a sexual assault. With the examinee\u2019s consent, the physical evidence collected during this medical exam can be used in a criminal investigation. To undergo a SAFE, go directly to the nearest emergency department that provides SAFE services.You may contact Shannon Medical Center at 325-653-6741 for assistance.",
