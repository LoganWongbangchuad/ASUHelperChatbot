        "By Laurel Scott",
        "For Angelo State University sophomore Mindy Holder, working on the History Department\u2019s grant-funded project, \u201cWar Stories: West Texans Experience War,\u201d has brought the past alive, but also opened her eyes to some of America\u2019s darkest times.",
        "World War II veteran Milton Plagens of San Angelo shared his memories with ASU student Mindy Holder of San Antonio for Angelo State's \u2018War Stories' project.",
        "A history major from San Antonio who plans to be a teacher, Holder is one of the first student workers on the project. She has been conducting interviews with veterans, scanning photographs and documents, and transcribing interviews, letters and journals to be included in a digital archive.",
        "\u201cMy immediate family is not involved in the military, but living in San Antonio, it seems like everyone else is,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing that struck me from the interviews was the hatred that people had toward the Vietnam veterans when they returned because I can\u2019t imagine treating someone like that, especially when they fought for our country.\u201d",
        "Dr. Kanisorn WongsrichanalaiThe \u201cWar Stories\u201d project is funded by a three-year National Endowment for the Humanities grant (NEH No. AC-226771-15) awarded in December 2014 to Dr. Christine Lamberson and Dr. Kanisorn Wongsrichanalai of ASU\u2019s history faculty.",
        "The goal of \u201cWar Stories\u201d is to collect and preserve the stories and experiences of armed forces personnel and their families with a West Texas connection from World War I to the present. The digital archive will serve as a research resource for future generations and a memorial to those Americans who helped shape the course of the 20th\u00a0and early 21st\u00a0centuries.",
        "The first step was to reach out to veterans and their families and invite them to participate.Submit your story onlineor view the growing archive on theWar Stories website.",
        "\u201cI interviewed a World War II veteran, transcribed a journal from someone who served in Iraq, sat in on an interview with a gentleman who is a Vietnam War veteran and talked with people from the Cold War era,\u201d Holder said. \u201cOne gentleman was in Berlin when the Wall was knocked down.\u201d",
        "\u201cI think it will help me in the long run to make history more personal for my students,\u201d she added. \u201cI can tell them about how I talked to this person and what they had to say about this conflict.\u201d",
        "Dr. Christine LambersonThe project is tackling a huge geographic area. Lamberson and Wongsrichanalai already have traveled to Alpine, Pecos and Marfa and visited retirement communities in San Angelo. They are planning trips to Waco, Eagle Pass and Del Rio.",
        "\u201cWe have learned that cooperating with local historical societies and universities is very beneficial,\u201d Wongsrichanalai said. \u201cWe ask them to help us contact and recruit veterans, family members and the community. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the support. There\u2019s a great deal of interest in preserving the past.\u201d",
        "Lamberson finds there is no shortage of veterans, especially in West Texas.",
        "\u201cI interviewed a World War II veteran, transcribed a journal from someone who served in Iraq, sat in on an interview with a gentleman who is a Vietnam War veteran and talked with people from the Cold War era.\u201d",
        "Mindy Holder, ASU student worker on the \u201cWar Stories\u201d project",
        "\u201cWe have a lot of people who are super excited to participate,\u201d she said, \u201cbut a lot of people who are excited we are doing this don\u2019t feel their personal story has value. We find this especially the case with family members, who we contend served alongside those in the armed forces. This is not a project that is simply about shooting on the battlefield. It\u2019s the whole gamut.\u201d",
        "The professors are also expanding the role of students in building the archive, tapping those in ASU history classes.",
        "\u201cThe students identified a lot of veterans who work for ASU,\u201d Wongsrichanalai said. \u201cThat was good, to draw them in.\u201d",
        "For sophomore history/political science major Justice Barkman of Cleburne, military service is part of his family\u2019s tradition. Working on the \u201cWar Stories\u201d project makes that family history even more relevant.",
        "ASU student Justice Barkman of Cleburne found working on the \u2018War Stories' project strengthened his appreciation for his family's history of military service.",
        "\u201cMost of what I\u2019ve done so far is transcriptions of interviews,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a long time. Every hour of audio takes roughly 10 hours to transcribe. My first one was with an Iraq veteran who was in the Marines. The third I did was a World War II veteran, a pilot for a bomber.\u201d",
        "\u201cIt gives you a different view of history,\u201d he added, \u201cnot just what is in textbooks. One of these guys said he didn\u2019t like talking about what he did in the military to civilians because they wouldn\u2019t understand. But they have these fantastic stories. The stories are absolutely invaluable and it\u2019s amazing to hear them.\u201d",
        "For more information on the \u201cWar Stories\u201d project, call the Department of History at 325-942-2324 or emailwarstories@angelo.edu.",
