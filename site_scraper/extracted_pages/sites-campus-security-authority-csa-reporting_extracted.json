        "The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act) requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to retain and disclose information about crimes in specific reporting geography. The purpose of this reporting form is to provide a process for documenting the details (What, When, and Where) of certain reportable crimes and/or non-criminal hate motivated incidents, which have been reported to a Campus Security Authority (CSA) other than the Angelo State University Police Department (ASUPD). Data collected on this form is to be used to increase public safety, not to identify the victim; therefore, the victim\u2019s identifying information is not included on this form. It is the policy of Angelo State University to encourage victims and/or witnesses to crime(s) to report such crimes to the ASUPD and/or to a designated Campus Security Authority. All cooperating victims who do not wish to remain anonymous should be directed to the ASUPD or the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction where the crime occurred.",
        "Clery documentation is not satisfied by simply directing/referring the reporting party to the police department. For the University to satisfy the statistical reporting requirements of the Clery Act, all CSA\u2019s are required to complete this form when any of the defined offenses are reported to them. After submission, the form will be forwarded to the Angelo State University Police Department; however, this is not a police report and will not generate a police report or police investigation. To file a police report, call the ASUPD at 325-942-2071 or your local law enforcement agency. After review, the CSA may be contacted for additional details or information.",
        "Please note that while completing this form fulfills your duty associated with the Clery Act, incidents that involve allegations of Sexual Misconduct as defined by Angelo State Operating Policy 16.03: Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Sexual Misconduct, and Title IX Policy and Complaint Procedure shall be promptly reported to the Title IX Coordinator who will work with ASUPD to ensure Clery obligations are met.",
        "If you are a victim of a crime and would like to report the crime, or if this is an emergency, you should contact the ASUPD at 325-942-2071 or call 911.",
        "To file a Clery report or review the Clery crime definitions, geography, or Angelo State University Annual Security Report, use the links above. Questions regarding this process should be directed to Mr. James Adams, Director of Public Safety and Chief of University Police, Angelo State University, at 325-942-2071.",
