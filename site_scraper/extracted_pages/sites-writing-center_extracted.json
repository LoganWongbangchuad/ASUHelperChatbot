        "Help with understanding an assignment and develop a topic:Understanding a written assignment is an imperative. Therefore, we ask all students to bring in the prompt provided by the instructor. By doing so, our tutors can help you to develop an appropriate topic that will follow the assignment guidelines.",
        "Experimenting with invention techniques:Some of your best ideas for a paper are developed through invention techniques, such as brainstorming and pre-writing. Our staff can help students identify which methods are best suited to their writing style.",
        "Refining research skills:Our tutors can assist students in locating and using library and online research tools.",
        "Formulating a thesis:Many students have a difficult time developing a thesis. Writing Center tutors help students narrow their topic in order to develop an effective argument, which will help with organization and focus.",
        "Formatting and citing sources:Tutors can answer students\u2019 questions concerning proper format and citation. We have copies of several different style manuals in the Writing Center.",
        "Improving grammar:The ASU Honor Code prohibits the tutors from proofreading and editing a student\u2019s paper, but they can help identify recurring grammatical and mechanical errors.",
        "Developing reading comprehension skills:The Writing Center can recommend different strategies that help with reading comprehension.",
