        "Students interested in the Integrated B.B.A./M.B.A. in International Business will be required to complete a minimum of 150 semester credit hours of degree credit. Of this total, 120 semester credit hours will be at theundergraduate level and 30 semester credit hours will be at the graduatelevel. The undergraduate course requirements are identical to those for thenon-integrated B.B.A. in International Business, and the graduate courserequirements are identical to those for the M.B.A. Therefore, this five-yearintegrated B.B.A./M.B.A. program has a true 4+1 modular structure.",
        "Candidates for this program must meet the current admission requirementsfor the M.B.A. program and be unconditionally admitted before taking anygraduate M.B.A. courses. The student must achieve a cumulative GPA of3.00 or better in all undergraduate courses and a cumulative GPA of 3.00 orbetter in all graduate courses.",
        "A unique feature of the integrated program is that the student may begin taking graduate course work in his/her senior year. Upon successfulcompletion of all 150 semester credit hours of this five-year program, thestudent will be awarded both the B.B.A. in International Business and the M.B.A. degree at the same time; the student will not receive the B.B.A. inInternational Business after completing 120 semester credit hours at theundergraduate level.",
        "Should a student decide not to complete the M.B.A. portion of the integratedprogram, then this student would have to complete any remaining degreerequirements for the B.B.A. in International Business in order to be awardedthat degree. Because of the 4+1 structure of the integrated program, all ofthe undergraduate courses already completed as part of the integrated five-year program would count towards completion of the B.B.A. in InternationalBusiness."
