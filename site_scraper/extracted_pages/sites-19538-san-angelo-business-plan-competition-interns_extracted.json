        "This program is an excellent experiential learning opportunity for students, allowing them to apply what they learn in the classroom to real world business situations.",
        "December 12, 2024",
        "The ASU Small Business Development Center (SBDC) collaborates with the City of San Angelo Development Corporation and the Norris-Vincent College of Business in conducting the annual San Angelo Business Plan Competition. SBDC interns, students from the Norris-Vincent College of Business, work closely with the advising staff in the operation of the competition to support small business success. This program is an excellent experiential learning opportunity for students, allowing them to apply what they learn in the classroom to real-world situations.",
        "NVCOB students are assigned to work under the tutelage of an SBDC Advisor to form a support team for the small business owners who have been selected as finalists in the competition. Throughout the competition process, these business owners lean on the advising team at the SBDC to assist in completing a full business plan, including financial projections, and preparing a live business pitch to present to a panel of judges. The businesses competing in the competition have the chance to win a grant award of up to $50,000 to further their business.",
        "As part of the internship program, students actively engage with SBDC Advisors, business owners, and civic leaders, building essential professional relationships and networks. They participate in the Small Business Management Certificate Program to achieve a student advisor certification, which equips them with foundational knowledge and skills for advising with practical business management techniques. Using these skills, students assist clients with in-depth business research, analyzing financial data, industry trends, and competitive landscapes to provide actionable insights. They also work closely with clients to develop detailed Cash Flow and Profit and Loss projections, ensuring compliance with the Business Plan Competition Guidelines.",
        "Throughout the competition, students support their assigned clients and SBDC Advisors by participating in one-on-one meetings, maintaining regular online communication, and completing independent tasks to move projects forward. By learning the nuances of building a trusted advisor relationship, students gain hands-on experience that enhances their resumes and prepares them for future careers in business or entrepreneurship, all while contributing directly to the success of the small business clients.",
        "Since its inception in 2016, the competition has been supported by over 40 students with many different academic disciplines, including undergraduate students pursuing degrees in Business Administration, Graduate Accounting students, and MBA students.",
        "LexiAnn Chatham, a 2024 Fall intern in the program, stated \u201cMy advisors have continued to be great and pour valuable information into me. They are very supportive while answering any questions I may have.\u201d Comments like this are echoed each year as students describe the experience as unique and extremely beneficial to their professional development, career aspirations, and experience in applying their classroom knowledge to the everyday reality of small business challenges. The SBDC Advisors strive to challenge the students to step out of their comfort zones and experience a world outside of the classroom.",
