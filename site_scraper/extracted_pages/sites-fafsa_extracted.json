        "The SAI is replacing the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) formula. This is a new need-analysis formula that financial aid staff will use when awarding need-based grants and scholarships. This formula change links award eligibility to family size and the federal poverty level, and will mean Pell grants will be offered to more students.",
        "If you haven\u2019t done so already, create an FSA ID, which is your account username and password. The FSA ID is a digital legal signature that lets you complete and update the FAFSA form, so create your own and keep it safe.Parents of dependent students will need to use their own FSA ID to complete the FAFSA process.",
        "We recommend creating your account early - even before you\u2019re ready to complete the FAFSA form. This extra step can avoid delays in the process, especially since it can take up to three days before you can use your FSA ID.",
        "Create your FSA ID",
        "A contributor is anyone who is required to provide information in support of a student\u2019s financial aid application. A contributor is a parent, guardian or student spouse. Each contributor will be required to have their own FSA ID and will need to consent to their information being included on the student\u2019s FAFSA.",
        "More Information on Parent Contributors",
        "Instead of entering their financial information manually, all contributors on a student\u2019s FAFSA application must consent for IRS Direct Data Exchange, allowing their data to be transferred directly to the FAFSA. There is no opt-out for this requirement. If a contributor does not consent, the student will be ineligible for federal aid.",
        "For more information about these FAFSA changes, see7 Key Changes Coming to the 2024\u201325 FAFSA\u00ae Experience."
