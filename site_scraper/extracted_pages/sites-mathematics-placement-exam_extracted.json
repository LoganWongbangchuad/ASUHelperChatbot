        "Welcome to the Angelo State University Mathematics Placement website. Please read through all the items below before accessing the placement program.",
        "If you\u00a0did not\u00a0receive an email from the Chair of the Department of Mathematics, Karl Havlak, regarding this placement program, you may not be eligible to take the placement exam. In such a case, please contact Dr. Havlak atKarl.Havlak@angelo.edubefore proceeding any further.",
        "Students who intend to major in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geoscience, mathematics, or physics will be required to complete a course that has college algebra as a prerequisite (see mathematics prerequisites and course requirements by major). You are being given access to a placement program free of charge that may allow you place out of college algebra and into a more advanced course.If you will be attending a New Student Orientation, please complete the placement program prior to attending the New Student Orientation, so that your placement scores are available for your advisor.",
        "The mathematics placement program to which you will be given access allows you to complete an assessment then review mathematical modules and reassess multiple times. The placement program requires an initial assessment exam, taken at any computer, which will indicate the mathematics class for which you appear to have the appropriate background. If you are not satisfied with this initial placement result, you will be given access to preparation modules that will help you review mathematics topics based on where the assessment instrument indicates you might have deficiencies. You will then be able to retest. This will enable you to clearly demonstrate the extent of your mathematical background.",
        "You will have access to the preparation modules for up to six months, and you can take an assessment up to five times. However,you must at the very least complete the initial assessment prior to the New Student Orientation for which you have registered. Your results will be made available to advisors at the New Student Orientation. The advisors will also take into account any college-level mathematics credit you may have earned through dual credit, AP, CLEP, or other sources to properly place you in a mathematics class.",
        "Please observe the Angelo State University\u2019s Code of Student Conduct when taking assessments. The university\u2019s policy on academic integrity is outlined inPart II, Section B. The assessments will not be proctored, but using outside resources of any kind violates the ASU Code of Student Conduct. Also, receiving assistance on assessments may result in you being placed in a course for which you do not have the proper background and put you at a high risk of failing the class.",
        "The link below will take you to the placement website. Once you are registered and you access the program, a short tutorial will be provided to give you an overview on taking assessments, entering answers, and working through preparation modules.",
        "Mathematics Placement Exam Registration",
        "Good luck, and please feel free to contact the Chair of the Department of Mathematics (Karl.Havlak@angelo.edu) with any questions you may have.",
