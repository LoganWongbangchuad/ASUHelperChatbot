        "The Bachelor of Intelligence and Analysis (B.I.A.) degree focuses on the interrelationships among intelligence, policy making, and national security and develops students with the competencies critical to accomplishing the missions of the United States intelligence community and national security enterprises. This program has similar requirements to the B.S.S. in Intelligence and Analysis; however, this program is designed for active-duty members of the United States Air Force.",
        "Intelligence and Analysis Elective CoursesChoose any nine hours of Intelligence and Analysis courses",
        "The B.I.A. degree has been approved by Air University to be included in the AU-ABC program. Degrees in the AU-ABC program allow students to transfer all 60 credit hours of their Associate of Applied Science Degree from CCAF into the course requirements. Since the B.I.A. requires 120 SCH and all 60 hours from the CCAF degree will be used, the student is only required to complete an additional 60 SCH to complete the B.I.A. degree.",
        "The Office of Admissions, in conjunction with the Department of Security Studies and Criminal Justice, will make an exception to standard policy with regard to Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) credits for a CCAF degree-holder. All credits from CCAF associate\u2019s degrees will be accepted and applied toward your degree plan. However, should you choose to change your degree plan to a degree other than the B.I.A. degree, the transfer credits originally accepted and applied may be revoked."
